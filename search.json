    "text": "How using a few ideas from software engineering can help data scientists, analysts and researchers write reliable code\n\n\n \n\nData scientists, statisticians, analysts, researchers, and many other professionals write a lot of code.\nNot only do they write a lot of code, but they must also read and review a lot of code as well. They either work in teams and need to review each other’s code, or need to be able to reproduce results from past projects, be it for peer review or auditing purposes. And yet, they never, or very rarely, get taught the tools and techniques that would make the process of writing, collaborating, reviewing and reproducing projects possible.\nWhich is truly unfortunate because software engineers face the same challenges and solved them decades ago.\nThe aim of this book is to teach you how to use some of the best practices from software engineering and DevOps to make your projects robust, reliable and reproducible. It doesn’t matter if you work alone, in a small or in a big team. It doesn’t matter if your work gets (peer-)reviewed or audited: the techniques presented in this book will make your projects more reliable and save you a lot of frustration!\nAs someone whose primary job is analysing data, you might think that you are not a developer. It seems as if developers are these genius types that write extremely high-quality code and create these super useful packages. The truth is that you are a developer as well. It’s just that your focus is on writing code for your purposes to get your analyses going instead of writing code for others. Or at least, that’s what you think. Because in others, your teammates are included. Reviewers and auditors are included. Any people that will read your code are included, and there will be people that will read your code. At the very least future you will read your code. By learning how to set up projects and write code in a way that future you will understand and not want to murder you, you will actually work towards improving the quality of your work, naturally.\nThe book can be read for free on https://raps-with-r.dev and you can buy a DRM-free Epub or PDF on Leanpub1.\nYou can submit issues, PRs and ask questions on the book’s Github repository."

This can be a simple quarterly report for example, in which the data is used for tables and graphs, or a scientific article for a peer reviewed journal or even an interactive web application. It doesn’t matter, because the process is, at its core, always very similar:\n\nGet the data;\nClean the data;\nWrite code to analyse the data;\nPut the results into the final product.\n\nThis book will already assume some familiarity with programming, and in particular the R programming language. However, if you’re comfortable with another programming language like Python, you could still learn a lot from reading this book. The tools presented in this book are specific to R, but there will always be an alternative for the language you prefer using, meaning that you could apply the advice from this book to your needs and preferences."

    "text": "1.2 What is the aim of this book?\nThe aim of this book is to make the process of analysing data as reliable, retraceable, and reproducible as possible, and do this by design. This means that once you’re done with the analysis, you’re done. You don’t want to spend time, which you often don’t have anyways, to rewrite or refactor an analysis and make it reproducible after the fact. We both know that this is not going to happen. Once an analysis is done, it’s time to go to the next analysis. And if you need to rerun an older analysis (for example, because the data got updated), then you’ll simply figure it out at that point, right? That’s a problem for future you, right? Hopefully, future you will remember every quirk of your code and know which script to run at which point in the process, which comments are outdated and can be safely ignored, what features of the data need to be checked (and when they need to be checked), and so on… You better hope future you is a more diligent worker than you!\nGoing forward, I’m going to refer to a project that is reproducible as a “reproducible analytical pipeline”, or RAP for short. There are only two ways to make such a RAP; either you are lucky enough to have someone on the team whose job is to turn your messy code into a RAP, or you do it yourself. And this second option is very likely the most common. The issue is, as stated above, that most of us simply don’t do it. We are always in the rush to get to the results, and don’t think about making the process reproducible. This is because we always think that making the process reproducible takes time and this time is better spent working on the analysis itself. But this is a misconception, for two reasons.\nThe first reason is that employing the techniques that we are going to discuss in this book won’t actually take much time. As you will see, they’re not really things that you “add on top of the analysis”, but will be part of the analysis itself, and they will also help with managing the project. And some of these techniques will even save you time (especially testing) and headaches.\nThe second reason is that an analysis is never, ever, a one-shot. Only the most simple things, like pulling out a number from some data base may be a one-shot. And even then, chances are that once you provide that number, you’ll be asked to pull out a variation of that number (for example, by disaggregating by one or several variables). Or maybe you’ll get asked for an update to that number in six months. So you will learn very quickly to keep that SQL query in a script somewhere to make sure that you provide a number that is consistent. But what about more complex analyses? Is keeping the script enough? Keeping the script is already a good start of course. The problem is that very often, there is no script, or not a script for each step of the analysis.\nI’ve seen this play out many times in many different organisations. It’s that time of the year again, we have to write a report. 10 people are involved, and just gathering the data is already complicated. Some get their data from Word documents attached to emails, some from a website, some from a report from another department that is a PDF… I remember a story that a senior manager at my previous job used to tell us: once, a client put out a call for a project that involved helping them setting up a PDF scraper. They periodically needed data from another department that came in PDFs. The manager asked what was, at least from our perspective, an obvious question: why can’t they send you the underlying data from that PDF in a machine readable format? They had never thought to ask. So my manager went to that department, and talked to the people putting that PDF together. Their answer? “Well, we could send them the data in any format they want, but they’ve asked us to send the tables in a PDF format”.\nSo the first, and probably most important lesson here is: when starting to build a RAP, make sure that you talk with all the people involved."

    "text": "1.3 Prerequisites\nYou should be comfortable with the R programming language. This book will assume that you have been using R for some projects already, and want to improve not only your knowledge of the language itself, but also how to successfully manage complex projects. Ideally, you should know about packages, how to install them, you should have written some functions already, know about loops and have some basic knowledge of data structures like lists. While this is not a book on visualisation, we will be making some graphs using the {ggplot2} package, so if you’re familiar with that, that’s good. If not, no worries, visualisation, data munging or data analysis is not the point of this book. Chapter 2, Before we start should help you gauge how easily you will be able to follow this book.\nIdeally, you should also not be afraid of not using Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). While you can follow along using an IDE like RStudio, I will not be teaching any features from any program with a GUI. This is not to make things harder than they should be (quite the contrary actually) but because interacting graphically with a program is simply not reproducible. So our aim is to write code that can be executed non-interactively by a machine. This is because one necessary condition for a workflow to be reproducible and get referred to as a RAP, is for the workflow to be able to be executed by a machine, automatically, without any human intervention. This is the second lesson of building RAPs: there should be no human intervention needed to get the outputs once the RAP is started. If you achieve this, then your workflow is likely reproducible, or can at least be made reproducible much more easily than if it requires some special manipulation by a human somewhere in the loop."

    "section": "1.4 What actually is reproducibility?",
    "text": "1.4 What actually is reproducibility?\nA reproducible project means that this project can be rerun by anyone at 0 (or very minimal) cost. But there are different levels of reproducibility, and I will discuss this in the next section. Let’s first discuss some requirements that a project must have to be considered a RAP.\n\n1.4.1 Using open-source tools to build a RAP is a hard requirement\nOpen source is a hard requirement for reproducibility.\nNo ifs nor buts. And I’m not only talking about the code you typed for your research paper/report/analysis. I’m talking about the whole ecosystem that you used to type your code and build the workflow.\nIs your code open? That’s good. Or is it at least available to other people from your organisation, in a way that they could re-execute it if needed? Good.\nBut is it code written in a proprietary program, like STATA, SAS or MATLAB? Then your project is not reproducible. It doesn’t matter if this code is well documented and written and available on a version control system (internally to your company or open to the public). This project is just not reproducible. Why?\nBecause on a long enough time horizon, there is no way to re-execute your code with the exact same version of the proprietary programming language and on the exact same version of the operating system that was used at the time the project was developed. As I’m writing these lines, MATLAB, for example, is at version R2022b. And buying an older version may not be simple. I’m sure if you contact their sales department they might be able to sell you an older version. Maybe you can even simply re-download older versions that you’ve already bought their website. But maybe it’s not that simple. Or maybe they won’t offer this option anymore in the future, who knows? In any case, if you google “purchase old version of Matlab” you will see that many researchers and engineers have this need.\n\n\n\nWanting to run older versions of analytics software is a recurrent need.\n\n\nAnd if you’re running old code written for version, say, R2008a, there’s no guarantee that it will produce the exact same results on version 2022b. And let’s not even mention the toolboxes (if you’re not familiar with MATLAB’s toolboxes, they’re the equivalent of packages or libraries in other programming languages). These evolve as well, and there’s no guarantee that you can purchase older versions of said toolboxes. And it’s likely that newer versions of toolboxes cannot even run on older versions of Matlab.\nAnd let me be clear, what I’m describing here with MATLAB could also be said for any other proprietary programs still commonly (unfortunately) used in research and in statistics (like STATA, SAS or SPSS). And even if some, or even all, of the editors of these proprietary tools provide ways to buy and run older versions of their software, my point is that the fact that you have to rely on them for this is a barrier to reproducibility, and there is no guarantee they will provide the option to purchase older versions forever. Also, who guarantees that the editors of these tools will be around forever? Or, and that’s more likely, that they will keep offering a program that you install on your machine instead of shifting to a subscription based model?\nFor just $199 a month, you can execute your SAS/STATA/MATLAB scripts on the cloud! Worry about data confidentiality? No worries, data gets encrypted and stored safely on our secure servers! Run your analysis from anywhere and don’t worry about losing your work if your cat knocks over your coffee on your laptop! And if you purchase the pro licence, for an additional $100 a month, you can even execute your code in parallel!\nThink this is science fiction? Google “SAS cloud” to see SAS’s cloud based offering.\n\n\n1.4.2 There are hidden dependencies that can hinder the reproducibility of a project\nThen there’s another problem: let’s suppose you’ve written a nice, thoroughly tested and documented workflow, and made it available on Github (and let’s even assume that the data is available for people to freely download, and that the paper is open access). Or, if you’re working in the private sector, you did everything above as well, the only difference being that the workflow is only available to people inside the company instead of being available freely and publicly online.\nLet’s further assume that you’ve used R or Python, or any other open source programming language. Could this study/analysis be said to be reproducible? Well, if the analysis ran on a proprietary operating system, then the conclusion is: your project is not reproducible.\nThis is because the operating system the code runs on can also influence the outputs that your pipeline builds. There are some particularities in operating systems that may make certain things work differently. Admittedly, this is in practice rarely a problem, but it does happen1, especially if you’re working with very high precision floating point arithmetic like you would do in the financial sector for instance.\nThankfully, there is no need to change operating systems to deal with this issue, and we will learn how to use Docker to safeguard against this problem.\n\n\n1.4.3 The requirements of a RAP\nSo where does that leave us? Basically, for something to be truly reproducible, it has to respect the following bullet points:\n\nSource code must obviously be available and thoroughly tested and documented (which is why we will be using Git and Github);\nAll the dependencies must be easy to find and install (we are going to deal with this using dependency management tools);\nTo be written with an open source programming language (nocode tools like Excel are by default non-reproducible because they can’t be used non-interactively, and which is why we are going to use the R programming language);\nThe project needs to be run on an open source operating system (thankfully, we can deal with this without having to install and learn to use a new operating system, thanks to Docker);\nData and the paper/report need obviously to be accessible as well, if not publicly as is the case for research, then within your company. This means that the concept of “scripts and/or data available upon request” belongs in the trash.\n\n\n\n\nA real sentence from a real paper published in THE LANCET Regional Health. How about make the data available and I won’t scratch your car, how’s that for a reasonable request?"

    "section": "1.5 Are there different types of reproducibility?",
    "text": "1.5 Are there different types of reproducibility?\nLet’s take one step back: we live in the real world, and in the real world, there are some constraints that are outside of our control. These constraints can make it impossible to build a true RAP, so sometimes we need to settle for something that might not be a true RAP, but a second or even third best thing.\nIn what follows, let’s assume this: in the discussion below, code is tested and documented, so let’s only discuss the code running the pipeline itself.\nThe worst reproducible pipeline would be something that works, but only on your machine. This can be simply due to the fact that you hardcoded paths that only exist on your laptop. Anyone wanting to rerun the pipeline would need to change the paths. This is something that needs to be documented in a README which we assumed was the case, so there’s that. But maybe this pipeline only runs on your laptop because the computational environment that you’re using is hard to reproduce. Maybe you use software, even if it’s open source software, that is not easy to install (anyone that tried to install R packages on Linux that depend on the {rJava} package know what I’m talking about).\nSo a least worse pipeline would be one that could be run more easily on any similar machine to yours. This could be achieved by not using hardcoded absolute paths, and by providing instructions to set up the environment. For example, in the case of R, this could be as simple as providing a script called something like install_deps.R that would be a call to install.packages(). It could look like this:\n\ninstall.packages(c(\"package1\",\n                   \"package2\",\n                   etc))\n\nThe issue here is that you need to make sure that the right versions of the packages get installed. If your script uses {ggplot2} version 2.2.1, then users should install this version as well, and by running the script above, the latest version of {ggplot2} (as of writing, version 3.4.0) will get installed. Maybe that’s not a problem, but it can be if your script uses a function from version 2.2.1 that is not available anymore in the latest version (or maybe its name got changed, or maybe it was modified somehow and doesn’t provide the exact same result). The more packages the script uses (and the older it is), the higher the likelihood that some package version will not be compatible. There is also the issue of the R version itself. Generally speaking, recent versions of R seem to not be too bad when it comes to running older code written in R. I know this because in 2022 I’ve run every example that comes bundled with R since version 0.6.0 on the then current version (as of writing) of R, version 4.2.2.\nHere is the result of this experiment:\n\n\n\nExamples from older versions of R run most of the time successfully on the current version of R\n\n\nThis graph shows the following: for each version of R, starting with R version 0.6.0 (released in 1997), how well the examples that came with a standard installation of R run on the current version of R (version 4.2.2 as of writing). These are the examples from the default packages like {base}, {stats}, {stats4}, and so on. Turns out that more than 75% of the example code from version 0.6.0 still work on the current version of R. A small fraction output a message (which doesn’t mean the code doesn’t work), some 5% raise a warning, which again doesn’t necessarily mean that the code doesn’t work, and finally around 20% or so produce errors. As you can see, the closer we get to the current release, the fewer errors get raised (if you want to run the code for yourself, check out this Github repository).\n(But something important should be noted: just because some old piece of code runs without error, doesn’t mean that the result is exactly the same. There might be cases where the same function returns different results on different versions of R.)\nWhile this is evidence of R itself being quite stable through time, there are studies that show a less rosy picture. In a recent study (Trisovic et al. (2022) 2), some researchers tried to rerun up to 9000 R scripts downloaded from the Harvard Dataverse. There were several issues when trying to rerun the scripts, which lead to, and I quote the paper here, “[…] 74% of R files [failing] to complete without error in the initial execution, while 56% failed when code cleaning was applied, showing that many errors can be prevented with good coding practices”.\nThe take-away message is that counting on the language itself being stable through time as a sufficient condition for reproducibility is not enough. We have to set up the code in a way that it actually is reproducible.\nSo what does this all mean? This means that reproducibility is on a continuum, and depending on the constraints you face your project can be “not very reproducible” to “totally reproducible”. Let’s consider the following list of anything that can influence how reproducible your project truly is:\n\nVersion of the programming language used;\nVersions of the packages/libraries of said programming language used;\nOperating System, and its version;\nVersions of the underlying system libraries (which often go hand in hand with OS version, but not necessarily).\nAnd even the hardware architecture that you run all that software stack on.\n\nSo by “reproducibility is on a continuum”, what I mean is that you could set up your project in a way that none, one, two, three, four or all of the preceding items are taken into consideration when making your project reproducible.\nThis is not a novel, or new idea. Peng (2011) already discussed this concept but named it the reproducibility spectrum. In part 2 of this book, I will reintroduce the idea and call it the “reproducibility iceberg”.\n\n\n\nThe reproducibility spectrum from Peng’s 2011 paper.\n\n\nLet me just finish this introduction by discussing the last item on the previous list: hardware architecture. You see, Apple has changed the hardware architecture of their computers recently. Their new computers don’t use Intel based hardware anymore, but instead Apple’s own proprietary architecture (Apple Silicon) based on the ARM specification. And what does that mean concretely? It means that all the binary packages that were built for Intel based Apple computers cannot run on their new computers (at least not without a compatibility layer). Which means that if you have a recent M1 or M2 Macbook and need to install old CRAN packages to rerun a project (and we will learn how to do this later in the book), these need to be compiled to work on Apple Silicon first. You cannot even install older versions of R, unless you also compile those from source! Now I have read about a compatibility layer called Rosetta which enables to run binaries compiled for the Intel architecture on the ARM architecture, and maybe this works well with R and CRAN binaries compiled for Intel architecture. Maybe, I don’t know. But my point is that you never know what might come in the future, and thus needing to be able to compile from source is important, because compiling from source is what requires the least amount of dependencies that are outside of your control. Relying on binaries is not future-proof (and which is again, another reason why open-source tools are a hard requirement for reproducibility).\nAnd for you Windows users, don’t think that the preceding paragraph does not concern you. I think that it is very likely that Microsoft will push in the future for OEM manufacturers to build more ARM based computers. There is already an ARM version of Windows after all, and it has been around for quite some time, and I think that Microsoft will not kill that version any time in the future. This is because ARM is much more energy efficient than other architectures, and any manufacturer can build its own ARM cpus by purchasing a license, which can be quite interesting from a business perspective. For example in the case of Apple Silicon cpus, Apple can now get exactly the cpus they want for their machines and make their software work seamlessly with it (also, further locking in their users to their hardware). I doubt that others will pass the chance to do the same.\nAlso, something else that might happen is that we might move towards more and more cloud based computing, but I think that this scenario is less likely than the one from before. But who knows. And in that case it is quite likely that the actual code will be running on Linux servers that will likely be ARM based because of energy and licensing costs. Here again, if you want to run your historical code, you’ll have to compile old packages and R versions from source.\nOk, so this might seem all incredibly complicated. How on earth are we supposed to manage all these risks and balance the immediate need for results with the future need of rerunning an old project? And what if rerunning this old project is not even needed in the future?\nThis is where this book will help you. By employing the techniques discussed in this book, not only will it be very easy and quick to set up a project from the ground up that is truly reproducible, the very fact of building the project this way will also ensure that you avoid mistakes and producing results that are wrong. It will be easier and faster to iterate and improve your code, to collaborate, and ultimately to trust the results of your pipelines. So even if no one will rerun that code ever again, you will still benefit from the best practices presented in this book. Let’s dive in!\n\n\n\n\nPeng, Roger D. 2011. “Reproducible Research in Computational Science.” Science 334 (6060): 1226–27.\n\n\nTrisovic, Ana, Matthew K Lau, Thomas Pasquier, and Mercè Crosas. 2022. “A Large-Scale Study on Research Code Quality and Execution.” Scientific Data 9 (1): 60."

By fundamental ingredients I mean those tools that you absolutely need to have in your toolbox before even attempting to make a project reproducible. These tools are so important, that a good chunk of this book is dedicated to them:\n\nVersion control;\nFunctional programming;\nLiterate programming.\n\nYou might already be familiar with these topics, and maybe already use them in your day to day. If that’s the case, you still might want to at least skim part 1 before tackling part 2 of the book, which will focus on another set of tools to actually build reproducible analytical pipelines (RAPs).\nSo this means that part 1 will not teach you how to build reproducible pipelines. But I cannot immediately start building reproducible analytical pipelines without first making sure that you understand the core concepts laid out above. To help us understand these concepts, we will start by analysing some data together. We are going to download, clean and plot some data, and we will achieve this by writing two scripts. These scripts will be written in a very “typical non software engineery” way, as to mimic how analysts, data scientists or researchers without any formal training in computer science would perform such an analysis. This does not mean that the quality of the analysis will be low. But it means that, typically, these programmers have delievering results fast, and by any means necessary, as the top priority. Our goal with this book is to show you, and hopefully convince you, that by adopting certain simple ideas from software engineering it is possible to deliver just as fast as before, but in a more consistent and robust way.\nLet’s get started!"

    "section": "2.1 Essential knowledge",
    "text": "2.1 Essential knowledge\nIt’s important to know the parts that constitute R. Let’s make something clear: R is not RStudio, or whatever interface you are using to interact with R. R is a domain-specific interpreted programming language. R is domain-specific because its primary use is in performing statistics. Interpreted, because results get returned immediately when you execute a script in the console. In other words, when you write 1+1 in the console, you get back 2 immediately. There are programming languages, called compiled programming languages, that require code to be compiled into binaries before execution. C is such a language. The fact that R is interpreted makes interactive exploratory data analysis easy, but also introduces certain negative aspects. I will discuss these in detail in the book. R’s console is an example of a REPL – Read-Eval-Print-Loop – environment. Code gets read, evaluated, printed and the read state gets returned, starting the loop over.\nTo make working with R easier, you should not write code in the console and execute it, but instead write it in a text file. You can keep these text files, update and share them with collaborators. Such text files are called scripts. You could write these scripts using the most basic text editor included in your operating system (that would be Notepad.exe on Windows for example), but you should instead use a text editor made specifically to make programming easier. Popular choices among R users include RStudio, Visual Studio Code, or maybe something more exotic like Emacs combined with ESS (my personal choice). Whatever text editor you choose, take time to configure it and learn how to use it. You will spend many, many, many hours inside that text editor. The code you write in that text editor is what’s going to feed you and your family. Learn your chosen text editor’s keyboard shortcuts and other advanced features. This initial investment will pay for itself many times over. Also, you need to know what an actual text file is. A document written in Word (with the .docx extension) is not a text file. It looks like text, but is not. The .docx format is a much more complex format with many layers of abstraction. “True” plain text files can be opened with the simplest text editor included in your operating system. I’ve had students trying to create text files with word processors like MS Word and then being confused when things would not work.\nAs stated before, R is a domain-specific programming language mainly used for doing statistics, or whatever modernized term you may prefer like “data science”. Its base capabilities can be extended by installing packages. For example, a base installation of R provides you with useful functions like mean() or sd(), to compute the average or standard deviation of a vector of numbers, or rnorm() to compute random variates from a Gaussian (Normal) distribution. However, there is no function available to train a random forest. If you need to train a random forest you need to install a package using the install.packages(\"randomForest\") command. This installs the {randomForest} package (in the rest of the book, I will surround package names with curly braces). The collection of packages installed is called a “library”. Packages get downloaded from CRAN, the Comprehensive R Archive Network. There is no doubt in my mind that the reason R became so popular is because it is quite easy to write packages for it; and this is something that we will learn as well! Some packages are written with other programming languages, very often Fortran or C++. The code included in these packages is then compiled and can be executed by R using a user-facing function. For example, if you dig into the source code of the {randomForest} package, you will find C and Fortran code. This is important to know, because sometimes R packages need to be compiled by install.packages(), and this compilation can sometimes fail (especially on Linux, but more on that later in the book).\nWhen you use R, you will load data sets, create plots, train models, etc. These data sets, plots, models, are all objects and they get saved in the global environment. To see a list of objects currently available in the global environment, type ls() in the R console. When you quit R, you get asked to save the workspace: this will save the current state of the global environment and load it next time you start R. I highly recommend for you to not save the workspace. If you are using RStudio you can change this behaviour in the global options (under Workspace, set Save workspace to .RData on exit to Never). Other editors might have a similar option. Saving and loading the workspace makes it impossible to start with a fresh R session (unless you start R with the --vanilla flag), which can cause issues that are difficult to pinpoint.\nYou should also be comfortable with paths and your computer’s file system. Comfortable means having no problems finding where a file gets downloaded for example, or being able to navigate to any folder, either through a GUI file browser or through a terminal (if you’re familiar with navigating your computer using the terminal, you will have an easier time with this book than if you didn’t). I also highly recommend that you strive to use relative paths in your scripts, and not absolute paths. In other words: don’t start your scripts with a line such as:\n\nsetwd(\"H:/Username/Projects/housing_regression/\")\n\nbut instead, use “Projects” if you’re using RStudio, or similar features from your preferred IDE. This way, you can use relative paths instead. This makes collaboration much easier. Using “Projects” in RStudio, if you need to load data, you can simply write:\n\ndataset &lt;- read.csv(\"data.csv\")\n\nand don’t need to set working directories using setwd(), which obviously will not exist on your collaborators computer.\nThere is also the {here} package that makes using relative paths easier, but I won’t discuss it in this book. If you’re interested you can read this post1.\nYou should be familiar with writing functions. This book has a whole chapter on functional programming, and I will teach you how to write functions, but if you’re already familiar with this, then it will make going through that chapter easier.\nFinally, you should know how to ask for help. If you need help with this book, feel free to open an issue on the book’s Github repo here2, or open a thread on the book’s Leanpub forum (if you bought a copy) over here3. Just like for this book, if you have an issue with an R package, look for its repository: many packages’ source code is hosted on Github (but not always). You can also try to reach out to the author, or open a thread on Stackoverflow. Whatever you do, make sure that you do your homework first:\n\nRead the documentation. Maybe you’re using the tool wrong.\nTake note of the error message. Error messages can be cryptic sometimes, but as you gain in experience, you will learn to decrypt them.\nWrite down the simplest script possible that reproduces the issue you’re facing. This is called an MRE, “Minimal Reproducible Example”. If you need to open a thread asking for help, post this MRE, this will make helping you much easier. For general advice on how to write an MRE, you can read this classic blog post4.\n\nFinally, keep in mind the following saying from my father, a mason (the ones that lay bricks, not the ones meeting in secrecy to govern the world):\n\nThe tools are always right. If you’re using a tool and it’s not behaving as expected, it is much more likely that your expectations are wrong. Take this opportunity to review your knowledge of the tool."

    "text": "3.1 Housing in Luxembourg\nWe are going to download data about house prices in Luxembourg. Luxembourg is a little Western European country the author hails from that looks like a shoe and is about the size of .98 Rhode Islands. Did you know that Luxembourg is a constitutional monarchy, and not a kingdom like Belgium, but a Grand-Duchy, and actually the last Grand-Duchy in the World? Also, what you should know to understand what we will be doing is that the country of Luxembourg is divided into Cantons, and each Cantons into Communes. If Luxembourg was the USA, Cantons would be States and Communes would be Counties (or Parishes or Boroughs). What’s confusing is that “Luxembourg” is also the name of a Canton, and of a Commune, which also has the status of a city and is the capital of the country. So Luxembourg the country, is divided into Cantons, one of which is called Luxembourg as well, cantons are divided into communes, and inside the canton of Luxembourg there’s the commune of Luxembourg which is also the city of Luxembourg, sometimes called Luxembourg-City, which is the capital of the country.\n\n\n\nLuxembourg is about as big as the US State of Rhode Island.\n\n\nWhat you should also know is that the population is about 645,000 as of writing (January 2023), half of which are foreigners. Around 400,000 persons work in Luxembourg, of which half do not live in Luxembourg; so every morning from Monday to Friday, 200,000 people enter the country to work and then leave in the evening to go back to either Belgium, France or Germany, the neighbouring countries. As you can imagine, this puts enormous pressure on the transportation system and on the roads, but also on the housing market; everyone wants to live in Luxembourg to avoid the horrible daily commute, and everyone wants to live either in the capital city, or in the second largest urban area in the south, in a city called Esch-sur-Alzette.\nThe plot below shows the value of the House Price Index through time for Luxembourg and the European Union:\n\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to download the data, click here1.\nLet us paste the definition of the HPI in here (taken from the HPI’s metadata2 page):\nThe House Price Index (HPI) measures inflation in the residential property market. The HPI captures price changes of all types of dwellings purchased by households (flats, detached houses, terraced houses, etc.). Only transacted dwellings are considered, self-build dwellings are excluded. The land component of the dwelling is included.\nSo from the plot, we can see that the price of dwellings more than doubled between 2010 and 2021; the value of the index is 214.81 in 2021 for Luxembourg, and 138.92 for the European Union as a whole.\nThere is a lot of heterogeneity though; the capital and the communes right next to the capital are much more expensive than communes from the less densely populated north, for example. The south of the country is also more expensive than the north, but not as much as the capital and surrounding communes. Not only is price driven by demand, but also by scarcity; in 2021, 0.5% of residents owned 50% of the buildable land for housing purposes (Source: Observatoire de l’Habitat, Note 29, archived download link3).\nOur project will be quite simple; we are going to download some data, supplied as an Excel file, compiled by the Housing Observatory (Observatoire de l’Habitat, a service from the Ministry of Housing, which monitors the evolution of prices in the housing market, among other useful services like the identification of vacant lots). The advantage of their data when compared to Eurostat’s data is that the data is disaggregated by commune. The disadvantage is that they only supply nominal prices, and no index (and the data is trapped inside Excel and not ready for analysis with R). Nominal prices are the prices that you read on price tags in shops. The problem with nominal prices is that it is difficult to compare them through time. Ask yourself the following question: would you prefer to have had 500€ (or USDs) in 2003 or in 2023? You probably would have preferred them in 2003, as you could purchase a lot more with $500 then than now. In fact, according to a random inflation calculator I googled, to match the purchasing power of $500 in 2003, you’d need to have $793 in 2023 (and I’d say that we find very similar values for €). But it doesn’t really matter if that calculation is 100% correct: what matters is that the value of money changes, and comparisons through time are difficult, hence why an index is quite useful. So we are going to convert these nominal prices to real prices. Real prices take inflation into account and so allow us to compare prices through time.\nSo to summarise; our goal is to:\n\nGet data trapped inside an Excel file into a neat data frame;\nConvert nominal to real prices using a simple method;\nMake some tables and plots and call it a day (for now).\n\nWe are going to start in the most basic way possible; we are simply going to write a script and deal with each step separately."

    "text": "3.2 Saving trapped data from Excel\nGetting data from Excel into a tidy data frame can be very tricky. This is because very often, Excel is used as some kind of dashboard or presentation tool. So data is made human-readable, in contrast to machine readable. Let us quickly discuss this topic as it is essential to grasp the difference between the two (and in our experience, a lot of collective pain inflicted to statisticians and researchers could have been avoided if this concept was more well-known). The picture below shows an Excel file made for human consumption:\n\n\n\nAn Excel file meant for human eyes.\n\n\nSo why is this file not machine-readable? Here are some issues:\n\nThe table does not start in the top-left corner of the spreadsheet, which is where most importing tools expect it to be;\nThe spreadsheet starts with a header that contains an image and some text;\nNumbers are text and use “,” as the thousands separator;\nYou don’t see it in the screenshot, but each year is in a separate sheet.\n\nThat being said, this Excel file is still very tame, and going from this Excel to a tidy data frame will not be too difficult. In fact, we suspect that whoever made this Excel file is well aware of the contradicting requirements of human and machine readable formatting of data, and strove to find a compromise. Because more often than not, getting human readable data into a machine readable format is a nightmare. We could call data like this machine-friendly data.\nIf you want to follow along, you can download the Excel file here4 (downloaded on January 2023 from the luxembourguish open data portal5). But you don’t need to follow along with code, because I will link the completed scripts for you to download later.\nEach sheet contains a dataset with the following columns:\n\nCommune: the commune (the smallest administrative division of territory);\nNombre d’offres: the total number of selling offers;\nPrix moyen annoncé en Euros courants: Average selling price in nominal Euros;\nPrix moyen annoncé au m2 en Euros courants: Average selling price in square meters in nominal Euros.\n\nFor ease of presentation, I’m going to show you each step of the analysis here separately, but I’ll be putting everything together in a single script once I’m done explaining each step. So first, let’s load some packages:\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(purrr)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(stringr)\nlibrary(janitor)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'janitor'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    chisq.test, fisher.test\n\n\nNext, the code below downloads the data, and puts it in a data frame:\n\n# The url below points to an Excel file\n# hosted on the book’s github repository\nurl &lt;- \"https://is.gd/1vvBAc\"\n\nraw_data &lt;- tempfile(fileext = \".xlsx\")\n\ndownload.file(url, raw_data, method = \"auto\", mode = \"wb\")\n\nsheets &lt;- excel_sheets(raw_data)\n\nread_clean &lt;- function(..., sheet){\n  read_excel(..., sheet = sheet) |&gt;\n    mutate(year = sheet)\n}\n\nraw_data &lt;- map(\n  sheets,\n  ~read_clean(raw_data,\n              skip = 10,\n              sheet = .)\n                   ) |&gt;\n  bind_rows() |&gt;\n  clean_names()\n\nNew names:\n• `*` -&gt; `*...3`\n• `*` -&gt; `*...4`\n\nraw_data &lt;- raw_data |&gt;\n  rename(\n    locality = commune,\n    n_offers = nombre_doffres,\n    average_price_nominal_euros = prix_moyen_annonce_en_courant,\n    average_price_m2_nominal_euros = prix_moyen_annonce_au_m2_en_courant,\n    average_price_m2_nominal_euros = prix_moyen_annonce_au_m2_en_courant\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(locality = str_trim(locality)) |&gt;\n  select(year, locality, n_offers, starts_with(\"average\"))\n\nIf you are familiar with the {tidyverse} the above code should be quite easy to follow. We start by downloading the raw Excel file and save the sheet names into a variable. We then use a function called read_clean(), which takes the path to the Excel file and the sheet names as an argument to read the required sheet into a data frame. We use skip = 10 to skip the first 10 lines in each Excel sheet because the first 10 lines contain a header. The last thing this function does is add a new column called year which contains the year of the data. We’re lucky, because the sheet names are the years: “2010”, “2011” and so on. We then map this function to the list of sheet names, thus reading in all the data from all the sheets into one list of data frames. We then use bind_rows(), to bind each data frame into a single data frame, by row. Finally, we rename the columns (by translating their names from French to English) and only select the required columns. If you don’t understand each step of what is going on, don’t worry too much about it; this book is not about learning how to use R.\nRunning this code results in a neat data set:\n\nraw_data\n\n# A tibble: 1,343 × 5\n   year  locality    n_offers average_price_nominal_euros average_price_m2_nom…¹\n   &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                       &lt;chr&gt;                 \n 1 2010  Bascharage       192 593698.31000000006          3603.57               \n 2 2010  Beaufort         266 461160.29                   2902.76               \n 3 2010  Bech              65 621760.22                   3280.51               \n 4 2010  Beckerich        176 444498.68                   2867.88               \n 5 2010  Berdorf          111 504040.85                   3055.99               \n 6 2010  Bertrange        264 795338.87                   4266.46               \n 7 2010  Bettembourg      304 555628.29                   3343.22               \n 8 2010  Bettendorf        94 495074.38                   3235.26               \n 9 2010  Betzdorf         119 625914.47                   3343.05               \n10 2010  Bissen            70 516465.57                   3321.65               \n# ℹ 1,333 more rows\n# ℹ abbreviated name: ¹​average_price_m2_nominal_euros\n\n\nBut there’s a problem: columns that should be of type numeric are of type character instead (average_price_nominal_euros and average_price_m2_nominal_euros). There’s also another issue, which you would eventually catch as you’ll explore the data: naming of the communes is not consistent. Let’s take a look:\n\nraw_data |&gt;\n  filter(grepl(\"Luxembourg\", locality)) |&gt;\n  count(locality)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  locality             n\n  &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;int&gt;\n1 Luxembourg           9\n2 Luxembourg-Ville     2\n\n\nWe can see that the city of Luxembourg is spelled in two different ways. It’s the same with another commune, Pétange:\n\nraw_data |&gt;\n  filter(grepl(\"P.tange\", locality)) |&gt;\n  count(locality)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  locality     n\n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;int&gt;\n1 Petange      9\n2 Pétange      2\n\n\nSo sometimes it is spelled correctly, with an “é”, sometimes not. Let’s write some code to correct both these issues:\n\nraw_data &lt;- raw_data |&gt;\n  mutate(locality = ifelse(grepl(\"Luxembourg-Ville\", locality),\n                           \"Luxembourg\",\n                           locality),\n         locality = ifelse(grepl(\"P.tange\", locality),\n                           \"Pétange\",\n                           locality)\n         ) |&gt;\n  mutate(across(starts_with(\"average\"), as.numeric))\n\nWarning: There were 2 warnings in `mutate()`.\nThe first warning was:\nℹ In argument: `across(starts_with(\"average\"), as.numeric)`.\nCaused by warning:\n!

Let’s see what happened:\n\nraw_data |&gt;\n  filter(is.na(average_price_nominal_euros))\n\n# A tibble: 290 × 5\n   year  locality         n_offers average_price_nomina…¹ average_price_m2_nom…²\n   &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;dbl&gt;                  &lt;dbl&gt;                  &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 2010  Consthum               29                     NA                     NA\n 2 2010  Esch-sur-Sûre           7                     NA                     NA\n 3 2010  Heiderscheid           29                     NA                     NA\n 4 2010  Hoscheid               26                     NA                     NA\n 5 2010  Saeul                  14                     NA                     NA\n 6 2010  &lt;NA&gt;                   NA                     NA                     NA\n 7 2010  &lt;NA&gt;                   NA                     NA                     NA\n 8 2010  Total d'offres      19278                     NA                     NA\n 9 2010  &lt;NA&gt;                   NA                     NA                     NA\n10 2010  Source : Minist…       NA                     NA                     NA\n# ℹ 280 more rows\n# ℹ abbreviated names: ¹​average_price_nominal_euros,\n#   ²​average_price_m2_nominal_euros\n\n\nIt turns out that there are no prices for certain communes, but that we also have some rows with garbage in there. Let’s go back to the raw data to see what this is about:\n\n\n\nAlways look at your data.\n\n\nSo it turns out that there are some rows that we need to remove. We can start by removing rows where locality is missing. Then we have a row where locality is equal to “Total d’offres”. This is simply the total of every offer from every commune. We could keep that in a separate data frame, or even remove it. Finally there’s a row, the last one, that states the source of the data, which we can remove.\nIn the screenshot above, we see another row that we don’t see in our filtered data frame: one where n_offers is missing. This row gives the national average for columns average_prince_nominal_euros and average_price_m2_nominal_euros. What we are going to do is create two datasets: one with data on communes, and the other on national prices. Let’s first remove the rows stating the sources:\n\nraw_data &lt;- raw_data |&gt;\n  filter(!grepl(\"Source\", locality))\n\nLet’s now only keep the communes in our data:\n\ncommune_level_data &lt;- raw_data |&gt;\n    filter(!grepl(\"nationale|offres\", locality),\n           !is.na(locality))\n\nAnd let’s create a dataset with the national data as well:\n\ncountry_level &lt;- raw_data |&gt;\n  filter(grepl(\"nationale\", locality)) |&gt;\n  select(-n_offers)\n\noffers_country &lt;- raw_data |&gt;\n  filter(grepl(\"Total d.offres\", locality)) |&gt;\n  select(year, n_offers)\n\ncountry_level_data &lt;- full_join(country_level, offers_country) |&gt;\n  select(year, locality, n_offers, everything()) |&gt;\n  mutate(locality = \"Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg\")\n\nJoining with `by = join_by(year)`\n\n\nNow the data looks clean, and we can start the actual analysis… or can we? Before proceeding, it would be nice to make sure that we got every commune in there. For this, we need a list of communes from Luxembourg. Thankfully, Wikipedia has such a list.6\nLet’s scrape and save this list:\n\ncurrent_communes &lt;-\n  \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_communes_of_Luxembourg\" |&gt;\n  rvest::read_html() |&gt;\n  rvest::html_table() |&gt;\n  purrr::pluck(1) |&gt;\n  janitor::clean_names()\n\nWe scrape the table from the Wikipedia page using {rvest}. rvest::html_table() returns a list of tables from the Wikipedia table, and then we use purrr::pluck() to keep the first table from the website, which is what we need (I made the calls to the packages explicit, because you might not be familiar with these packages). janitor::clean_names() transforms column names written for human eyes into machine friendly names (for example Growth rate in % would be transformed to growth_rate_in_percent).\nLet’s see if we have all the communes in our data:\n\nsetdiff(unique(commune_level_data$locality), current_communes$commune)\n\n [1] \"Bascharage\"          \"Boevange-sur-Attert\" \"Burmerange\"         \n [4] \"Clémency\"            \"Consthum\"            \"Ermsdorf\"           \n [7] \"Erpeldange\"          \"Eschweiler\"          \"Heiderscheid\"       \n[10] \"Heinerscheid\"        \"Hobscheid\"           \"Hoscheid\"           \n[13] \"Hosingen\"            \"Luxembourg\"          \"Medernach\"          \n[16] \"Mompach\"             \"Munshausen\"          \"Neunhausen\"         \n[19] \"Redange-sur-Attert\"  \"Rosport\"             \"Septfontaines\"      \n[22] \"Tuntange\"            \"Wellenstein\"         \"Kaerjeng\"           \n\n\nWe see many communes that are in our commune_level_data, but not in current_communes. There’s one obvious reason: differences in spelling, for example, “Kaerjeng” in our data, but “Käerjeng” in the table from Wikipedia. But there’s also a less obvious reason; since 2010, several communes have merged into new ones. So there are communes that are in our data in 2010 and 2011, but disappear from 2012 onwards. So we need to do several things: first, get a list of all existing communes from 2010 onwards, and then, harmonise spelling. Here again, we can use a list from Wikipedia:\n\nformer_communes &lt;-\n  \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communes_of_Luxembourg#Former_communes\" |&gt;  \n  rvest::read_html() |&gt;\n  rvest::html_table() |&gt;\n  purrr::pluck(3) |&gt;\n  janitor::clean_names() |&gt;\n  dplyr::filter(year_dissolved &gt; 2009)\n\nformer_communes\n\n# A tibble: 20 × 3\n   name                year_dissolved reason                         \n   &lt;chr&gt;                        &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                          \n 1 Bascharage                    2011 merged to form Käerjeng        \n 2 Boevange-sur-Attert           2018 merged to form Helperknapp     \n 3 Burmerange                    2011 merged into Schengen           \n 4 Clemency                      2011 merged to form Käerjeng        \n 5 Consthum                      2011 merged to form Parc Hosingen   \n 6 Ermsdorf                      2011 merged to form Vallée de l'Ernz\n 7 Eschweiler                    2015 merged into Wiltz              \n 8 Heiderscheid                  2011 merged into Esch-sur-Sûre      \n 9 Heinerscheid                  2011 merged into Clervaux           \n10 Hobscheid                     2018 merged to form Habscht         \n11 Hoscheid                      2011 merged to form Parc Hosingen   \n12 Hosingen                      2011 merged to form Parc Hosingen   \n13 Mompach                       2018 merged to form Rosport-Mompach \n14 Medernach                     2011 merged to form Vallée de l'Ernz\n15 Munshausen                    2011 merged into Clervaux           \n16 Neunhausen                    2011 merged into Esch-sur-Sûre      \n17 Rosport                       2018 merged to form Rosport-Mompach \n18 Septfontaines                 2018 merged to form Habscht         \n19 Tuntange                      2018 merged to form Helperknapp     \n20 Wellenstein                   2011 merged into Schengen           \n\n\nAs you can see, since 2010 many communes have merged to form new ones. We can now combine the list of current and former communes, as well as harmonise their names:\n\ncommunes &lt;- unique(c(former_communes$name, current_communes$commune))\n# we need to rename some communes\n\n# Different spelling of these communes between wikipedia and the data\n\ncommunes[which(communes == \"Clemency\")] &lt;- \"Clémency\"\ncommunes[which(communes == \"Redange\")] &lt;- \"Redange-sur-Attert\"\ncommunes[which(communes == \"Erpeldange-sur-Sûre\")] &lt;- \"Erpeldange\"\ncommunes[which(communes == \"Luxembourg-City\")] &lt;- \"Luxembourg\"\ncommunes[which(communes == \"Käerjeng\")] &lt;- \"Kaerjeng\"\ncommunes[which(communes == \"Petange\")] &lt;- \"Pétange\"\n\nLet’s run our test again:\n\nsetdiff(unique(commune_level_data$locality), communes)\n\ncharacter(0)\n\n\nGreat! When we compare the communes that are in our data with every commune that has existed since 2010, we don’t have any commune that is unaccounted for. So are we done with cleaning the data? Yes, we can now start with analysing the data. Take a look here7 to see the finalised script. Also read some of the comments that I’ve added. This is a typical R script, and at first glance, one might wonder what is wrong with it. Actually, not much, but the problem if you leave this script as it is, is that it is very likely that we will have problems rerunning it in the future. As it turns out, this script is not reproducible. But we will discuss this in much more detail later on. For now, let’s analyse our cleaned data."

    "text": "3.3 Analysing the data\nWe are now going to analyse the data. The first thing we are going to do is compute a Laspeyeres price index. This price index allows us to make comparisons through time; for example, the index at year 2012 measures how much more expensive (or cheaper) housing became relative to the base year (2010). However, since we only have one ‘good’ (housing), this index becomes quite simple to compute: it is nothing but the prices at year t divided by the prices in 2010 (if we had a basket of goods, we would need to use the Laspeyeres index formula to compute the index at all periods).\nFor this section, I will perform a rather simple analysis. I will immediately show you the R script: take a look at it here8. For the analysis I selected 5 communes and plotted the evolution of prices compared to the national average.\nThis analysis might seem trivially simple, but it contains all the needed ingredients to illustrate everything else that I’m going to teach you in this book.\nMost analyses would stop here: after all, we have what we need; our goal was to get the plots for the 5 communes of Luxemourg, Esch-sur-Alzette, Mamer, Schengen (which gave its name to the Schengen Area9) and Wincrange. However, let’s ask ourselves the following important questions:\n\nHow easy would it be for someone else to rerun the analysis?\nHow easy would it be to update the analysis once new data gets published?\nHow easy would it be to reuse this code for other projects?\nWhat guarantee do we have that if the scripts get run in 5 years, with the same input data, we get the same output?\n\nLet’s answer these questions one by one."

    "section": "3.4 Your project is not done",
    "text": "3.4 Your project is not done\n\n3.4.1 How easy would it be for someone else to rerun the analysis?\nThe analysis is composed of two R scripts, one to prepare the data, another to actually run the analysis proper. Performing the analysis might seem quite easy, because each script contains comments as to what is going on, and the code is not that complicated. However, we are missing any project-level documentation that would provide clear instructions as to how to run the analysis. This might seem simple for us who wrote these scripts, but we are familiar with R, and this is still fresh in our brains. Should someone less familiar with R have to run the script, there is no clue for them as to how they should do it. And of course, should the analysis be more complex (suppose it’s composed of a dozens scripts), this gets even worse. It might not even be easy for you to remember how to run this in 5 months!\nAnd what about the required dependencies? Many packages were used in the analysis. How should these get installed? Ideally, the same versions of the packages you used and the same version of R should get used by that person to rerun the analysis.\nAll of this still needs to be documented, but listing the packages that were used for an analysis and their versions takes quite some time. Thankfully, in part 2, we will learn about the {renv} package to deal with this in a couple lines of code.\n\n\n3.4.2 How easy would it be to update the project?\nIf new data gets published, all the points discussed previously are still valid, plus you need to make sure that the updated data is still close enough to the previous data such that it can pass through the data cleaning steps you wrote. You should also make sure that the update did not introduce a mistake in past data, or at least alert you if that is the case. Sometimes, when new years get added, data for previous years also get corrected, so it would be nice to make sure that you know this. Also, in the specific case of our data, communes might get fused into a new one, or maybe even divided into smaller communes (even though this has not happened in a long time, it is not entirely out of the question).\nIn summary, what is missing from the current project are enough tests to make sure that an update to the data can happen smoothly.\n\n\n3.4.3 How easy would it be to reuse this code for another project?\nSaid plainly, not very easy. With code in this state you have no choice but to copy and paste it into a new script and change it adequately. For re-usability, nothing beats structuring your code into functions and ideally you would even package them. We are going to learn just that in future chapters of this book.\nBut sometimes you might not be interested in reusing code for another project: however, even if that’s the case, structuring your code into functions and packaging them makes it easy to reuse code even inside the same project. Look at the last part of the analysis.R script: we copied and pasted the same code 5 times and only slightly changed it. We are going to learn how not to repeat ourselves by using functions and you will immediately see the benefits of writing functions, even when simply to reuse them inside the same project.\n\n\n3.4.4 What guarantee do we have that the output is stable through time?\nNow this might seem weird: after all, if we start from the same dataset, does it matter when we run the scripts? We should be getting the same result if we build the project today, in 5 months or in 5 years. Well, not necessarily. While it is true that R is quite stable, this cannot necessarily be said of the packages that we use. There is no guarantee that the authors of the packages will not change the package’s functions to work differently, or take arguments in a different order, or even that the packages will all be available at all in 5 years. And even if the packages are still available and function the same, bugs in the packages might get corrected that could alter the result. This might seem like a non-problem; after all, if bugs get corrected, shouldn’t you be happy to update your results as well? But this depends on what it is we’re talking about. Sometimes it is necessary to reproduce results exactly as they were, even if they were wrong, for example in the context of an audit.\nSo we also need a way to somehow snapshot and freeze the computational environment that was used to create the project originally."

Try to run the following command in a terminal to see if this is the case:\nwhich git\nIf a path like /usr/bin/git gets shown, congratulations, you can skip the rest of this paragraph. If something like:\n/usr/bin/which: no git in (/home/username/.local/bin:/home/username/bin:etc...)\ngets shown instead, then this means that Git is not installed on your system. To install Git, use your distribution’s package manager, as it is very likely that Git is packaged for your system. On Ubuntu, arguably the most popular Linux distribution, this means running:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install git\nIf you’re using Ubuntu, may instead use apt instead of apt-get. Both commands are basically interchangeable, use whatever you’re used to. I’ve first used Ubuntu in 2008, and even though I don’t use it anymore as my daily Linux distro (that honor goes to openSUSE), I still use apt-get out of habit.\nOn macOS and Windows, follow the instructions from the Git Book2. It should be as easy as running an installer for any program.\nDepending on your operating system, a graphical user interface might have been installed with Git, making it possible to interact with Git outside of the command line. It is also possible to use Git from within RStudio and many other editors have interfaces to Git as well. We are not going to use any graphical user interface however. This is because there is no common, universal graphical user interface; they all work slightly differently. The only universal is the command line. Also, learning how to use Git via the command line will make it easier the day you will need to use it from a server, which will very likely happen. It also makes my job easier: it is simpler to tell you which commands to run and explain them to you than littering the book with dozens upon dozens of screenshots that might get outdated as soon as a new version of the interface gets released.\nDon’t worry, using the command line is not as hard as it sounds.\nIf you don’t already have a Github account, now is the time to create one. Just go over to https://github.com/ and simply follow the instructions and select the free tier to open your account.\n\n\n\nThis is your Github dashboard.\n\n\nIn the next section, we are going to learn some basic Git commands by versioning the two scripts that we wrote before."

    "section": "4.2 Git superbasics",
    "text": "4.2 Git superbasics\nWe are going to use the two script that we wrote in the previous section. If you want to follow along, create a folder called housing and put the two scripts we developed before in there:\n\nsave_data.R: https://is.gd/7PhUjd\nanalysis.R: https://is.gd/qCJEbi\n\nOpen the folder that contains the two scripts in a file explorer. On most Linux desktop environments you should be able to right-click inside that folder anywhere on a blank space and select an option titled something like “Open Terminal here”. If you’re using Windows, you can pretty much do the same but look instead for the option titled “Open Git Bash here”. On macOS, you need to first activate this option. Simply google for “open terminal at folder macOS” and follow the instructions. It is also possible to drag and drop a folder into a terminal which will then open the correct path in the terminal. Another option, of course, is to simply open a terminal and navigate to the correct folder using cd (change directory, this should work the same on Windows, macOS and Linux):\ncd /home/user/housing/\nMake sure that you are in the right folder by listing the contents of the folder:\nls\nOne little thing: from now on, the prompt of a terminal (or Git bash terminal on Windows) will start with owner@localhost. This is the user called owner (“owner” simply because that will be the project manager in our examples from now on) and the computer owner uses is called localhost (this prompt can look different on your machine, sometimes the full path to the current working directory is listed instead). So here is what happens when owner runs ls on the root directory of the project:\nowner@localhost ➤ ls\nanalysis.R save_data.R\n(On Linux you could also try ll which is often available. It is an alias for ls -l which provides a more detailed view. There’s also ls -la which also lists hidden files.)\nMake sure that you see the two scripts being listed when running ls. If not, this means that you are in the wrong directory, so make sure that you open the terminal in the correct folder.\nIt’s now time to start tracking these files using Git. In the same terminal in which we ran ls, run now the following git command:\nowner@localhost ➤ git init\nhint: Using 'master' as the name for the initial branch.\nhint: This default branch name is subject to change. \nhint: To configure the initial branch name to use in all of your\nhint: new repositories, which will suppress this warning, call:\nhint: \nhint:   git config --global init.defaultBranch &lt;name&gt;\nhint: \nhint: Names commonly chosen instead of 'master' are 'main', \nhint: 'trunk' and 'development'. The just-created branch can be \nhint: renamed via this command:\nhint: \nhint:   git branch -m &lt;name&gt;\nInitialized empty Git repository in /home/user/housing/.git/\nTake some time to read the hints. Many git commands give you hints and it’s always a good idea to read them. This hint here tells us that the default branch name is “master” and that this is subject to change. Think of a branch as a version of your code. The “master” branch will hold the default version of your code. But you could create a branch called “dev” that would contain a version of the code with features that are still in development. There is nothing special about the default, “master” branch, and it could have been called anything else. For example, if you create a repository on Github first, instead of creating it on your computer, the default branch will be called “main”. You need to pay attention to this, because when we will start interacting with our Github repository, we need to make sure that we have the right branch name in mind. Also, note that because the “master” branch is the most important branch, it gets sometimes referred to as the “trunk”. Some teams that use trunk based development (which I will discuss in the next chapter) even name this branch “trunk”. Let’s now run this other git command:\nowner@localhost ➤ git status\nOn branch master\n\nNo commits yet\n\nUntracked files:\n  (use \"git add &lt;file&gt;...\" to include in what will be committed)\n        analysis.R\n        save_data.R\n\nnothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track)\nGit tells us quite clearly that it sees two files, but that they’re currently not being tracked. So if we would modify them, Git would not keep track of the changes. So it’s a good idea to just do what Git tells us to do: let’s add them so that Git can track them:\nowner@localhost ➤ git add\nNothing specified, nothing added.\nhint: Maybe you wanted to say 'git add .'?\nhint: Turn this message off by running\nhint: \"git config advice.addEmptyPathspec false\"\nShoot, simply running git add does not do us any good. We need to specify which files we want to add. We can name them one by one, for example git add file1.R file2.txt, but if we simply want to track all the files in the folder, we can simply use the . placeholder:\nowner@localhost ➤ git add .\nNo message this time… is that a good thing? Let’s run git status and see what’s going on:\nowner@localhost ➤ git status\nOn branch master\n\nNo commits yet\n\nChanges to be committed:\n  (use \"git rm --cached &lt;file&gt;...\" to unstage)\n        new file:   analysis.R\n        new file:   save_data.R\nNice! Our two files are being tracked now, so we can commit the changes. Committing means that we are happy with our work, and we can snapshot it. These snapshots then get uploaded to Github by pushing them. This way, the changes will be available for our coworkers for them to pull. I’ll explain what this means later, so don’t worry if this is confusing, it won’t be by the end of the chapter. Also, you should know that there is a special file, called .gitignore, that allows you to list files or folders that you want Git to ignore. This can be useful in cases where you are working with sensitive data and don’t want it to be uploaded to Github. We will not use the .gitignore file just yet, but will do so in part two of the book. So for now, just remember that this is an option.\nWe are now ready to commit our files. Each commit must have a commit message, and we can write this message as an option to the git commit command:\nowner@localhost ➤ git commit -m \"Project start\"\nThe -m option is there to specify the message for the commit. Before pushing the commit, let’s run git status again:\nowner@localhost ➤ git status\nOn branch master\nnothing to commit, working tree clean\nThis means that every change is accounted for in a commit. So if we were to push now, we could then set our computer on fire: every change would be safely backed up on Github.com. We can also choose to not push yet, and keep working and committing. For example, we could commit 5 times and just push once: all of the 5 commits would be pushed to Github.com.\nLet’s do just that by changing one file. Open analysis.R in any editor and simply change the start of the script by adding one line. So go from:\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(purrr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nTo:\n# This script analyses housing data for Luxembourg\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(purrr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nand now run git status again:\nowner@localhost ➤ git status\nOn branch master\nChanges not staged for commit:\n  (use \"git add &lt;file&gt;...\" to update what will be committed)\n  (use \"git restore &lt;file&gt;...\" to discard changes in working directory)\n        modified:   analysis.R\n\nno changes added to commit (use \"git add\" and/or \"git commit -a\")\nBecause the file is being tracked, Git can now tell us that something changed and that we did not commit this change. So if our computer would self-combust, these changes would get lost forever. Better commit them and push them to Github.com as soon as possible!\nRemember, first, we need to add these changes to a commit using git add .:\nowner@localhost ➤ git add .\n(You can run git status at this point to check if the file was correctly added to be committed.)\nThen, we need to commit the changes and add a nice commit message:\nowner@localhost ➤ git commit -m \"Added a comment to analysis.R\"\nTry to keep commit messages as short and as explicit as possible. This is not always easy, but it really pays off to strive for short, clear messages. Also, ideally, you would want to keep commits as small as possible, ideally one commit per change. For example, if you’re adding and amending comments in scripts, once you’re done with that make this a commit. Then, maybe clean up some code. That’s another, separate commit. This makes rolling back changes or reviewing them much easier. This will be crucial later on when we will use trunk based development to collaborate with our teammates on a project. It is generally not a good idea to code all day and then only push one single big fat commit at the end of the day, but that is what happens very often…\nBy the way, even if our changes are still not on Github.com, we can still roll back to previous commits. For example, suppose that I delete the file accidentally by running rm analysis.R:\nowner@localhost ➤ rm analysis.R\nLet’s run git status and look for the changes (it’s a line starting with the word deleted):\nOn branch master\nChanges not staged for commit:\n  (use \"git add/rm &lt;file&gt;...\" to update what will be committed)\n  (use \"git restore &lt;file&gt;...\" to discard changes in working directory)\n        deleted:    analysis.R\n\nno changes added to commit (use \"git add\" and/or \"git commit -a\")\nYep, analysis.R is gone. And deleting on the console usually means that the file is gone forever. Well technically no, there are still ways to recover deleted files using certain tools, but since we were using Git we can use it to recover the files! Because we did not commit the deletion of the file, we can simple tell Git to ignore our changes. A simple way to achieve this is to stash the changes, and then drop (or delete) the stash:\nowner@localhost ➤ git stash\nSaved working directory and index state WIP on master: \\\n  ab43b4b Added a comment to analysis.R\nSo the deletion was stashed away, (so in case we want it back we could get it back with git stash pop) and our project was rolled back to the previous commit. Simply take a look at the files:\nowner@localhost ➤ ls\nanalysis.R save_data.R\nThere it is! You can get rid of the stash with git stash drop. But what if we had deleted the file and committed the change? In this scenario we could not use git stash, but we would need to revert to a commit. Let’s try, first let me remove the file:\nowner@localhost ➤ rm analysis.R\nand check the status with git status:\nOn branch master\nChanges not staged for commit:\n  (use \"git add/rm &lt;file&gt;...\" to update what will be committed)\n  (use \"git restore &lt;file&gt;...\" to discard changes in working directory)\n        deleted:    analysis.R\n\nno changes added to commit (use \"git add\" and/or \"git commit -a\")\nLet’s add these changes and commit them:\nowner@localhost ➤ git add .\nowner@localhost ➤ git commit -m \"Removed analysis.R\"\n[master 8e51867] Removed analysis.R\n 1 file changed, 131 deletions(-)\n delete mode 100644 analysis.R\nWhat’s the status now?\nowner@localhost ➤ git status\nOn branch master\nnothing to commit, working tree clean\nNow, we’ve done it! git stash won’t be of any help now. So how to recover our file? For this, we need to know to which commit we want to roll back. Each commit not only has a message, but also an unique identifier that you can access with git log:\nowner@localhost ➤ git log\ncommit 8e51867dc5ae89e5f2ab2798be8920e703f73455 (HEAD -&gt; master)\nAuthor: User &lt;owner@mailbox.com&gt;\nDate:   Sun Feb 5 17:54:30 2023 +0100\n\n    Removed analysis.R\n\ncommit ab43b4b1069cd987685253632827f19d7a402b27\nAuthor: User &lt;owner@mailbox.com&gt;\nDate:   Sun Feb 5 17:41:52 2023 +0100\n\n    Added a comment to analysis.R\n\ncommit df2beecba0101304f1b56e300a3cd713ce7366e5\nAuthor: User &lt;owner@mailbox.com&gt;\nDate:   Sun Feb 5 17:32:26 2023 +0100\n\n    Project start\n\nThe first one from the top is the last commit we’ve made. We would like to go back to the one with the message “Added a comment to analysis.R”. See the very long string of characters after “commit”? That’s the commit’s unique identifier, called hash. You need to copy it (or only like the first 10 or so characters, that’s enough as well). By the way, depending on your terminal and operating system, git log may open less to view the log. less is a program that makes it easy to view long documents. Quit it by simply pressing q on your keyboard. We are now ready to revert to the right commit with the following command:\nowner@localhost ➤ git revert ab43b4b1069cd98768..HEAD\nand we’re done! Check that all is right by running ls to see that the file magically returned, and git log to read the log of what happened:\nowner@localhost ➤ git log\ncommit b7f82ee119df52550e9ca1a8da2d81281e6aac58 (HEAD -&gt; master)\nAuthor: User &lt;owner@mailbox.com&gt;\nDate:   Sun Feb 5 18:03:37 2023 +0100\n\n    Revert \"Removed analysis.R\"\n    \n    This reverts commit 8e51867dc5ae89e5f2ab2798be8920e703f73455.\n\ncommit 8e51867dc5ae89e5f2ab2798be8920e703f73455 (HEAD -&gt; master)\nAuthor: User &lt;owner@mailbox.com&gt;\nDate:   Sun Feb 5 17:54:30 2023 +0100\n\n    Removed analysis.R\n\ncommit ab43b4b1069cd987685253632827f19d7a402b27\nAuthor: User &lt;owner@mailbox.com&gt;\nDate:   Sun Feb 5 17:41:52 2023 +0100\n\n    Added a comment to analysis.R\n\ncommit df2beecba0101304f1b56e300a3cd713ce7366e5\nAuthor: User &lt;owner@mailbox.com&gt;\nDate:   Sun Feb 5 17:32:26 2023 +0100\n\n    Project start\nUsing a range of commits in git revert reverts all the commits from the starting commit (not included) to the last commit. In this example, because only the commit starting with 8e51867dc5 was included in that range, only this commit was reverted. You could have achieved the same result with git revert 8e51867dc5.\nThis small example illustrates how useful Git is, even without using Github, and even if working alone on a project. At the very least it offers you a way to simply walk back changes and gives you a nice timeline of your project. Maybe this does not impress you much, because we live in a world where cloud services like Dropbox made things like this very accessible. But where Git (with the help of a service like Github) really shines is when collaboration is needed. Git and code hosting services like Github make it possible to collaborate at very large scale: thousands of developers contribute to the Linux kernel, arguably the most successful open source project ever, powering most of today’s smartphones, servers, supercomputers and embedded computers,3 and you can use these tools to collaborate at a smaller scale very efficiently as well."

    "text": "4.3 Git and Github\nSo we got some work done on our machine and made some commits. We are now ready to push these commits to Github. “Pushing” means essentially uploading these changes to Github. This makes them available to your coworkers if you’re pushing to a private repository, or makes them available to the world if you’re pushing to a public repository.\nBefore pushing anything to Github though, we need to create a new repository. This repository will contain the code for our project, as well as all the changes that Git has been tracking on our machine. So if, for example, a new team member joins, he or she will be able to clone the repository to his or her computer and have access to every change, every commit message and every single bit of history of the project. If it’s a public repository, anyone will be able to clone the repository and contribute code to it. We are going to walk you through some examples of how to collaborate with Git using Github in the remainder of this chapter.\nSo, let’s first go back to https://github.com/ and create a new repository:\n\n\n\nCreating a new repository from your dashboard.\n\n\nYou will then land on this page:\n\n\n\nName your repository and choose whether it’s a public or private repository.\n\n\nName your repository, and choose whether it should be open to the world or if it should be private and only accessible to your coworkers. We are going to make it a public repository, but you could make it private and follow along, this would change nothing in what we’re going to learn.\nWe then land on this page:\n\n\n\nSome instructions to get you started.\n\n\nWe get some instructions on how to actually get started with our project. The first thing you need to do though is to click on “SSH”:\n\n\n\nMake sure to select ‘SSH’.\n\n\nThis will change the links in the instructions from https to ssh. We will explain why this is important in a couple of paragraphs. For now, let’s read the instructions. Since we have already started working, we need to follow the instructions titled “…or push an existing repository from the command line”. Let’s review these commands. This is what Github suggests we run:\ngit remote add origin git@github.com:rap4all/housing.git\ngit branch -M main\ngit push -u origin main\nWhat’s really important is the first command and last command. The first command adds a remote (referred to as origin) that points to our repository. If you’re following along, you should copy the link from your repository here. It would look exactly the same, but the user name rap4all would be replaced by your Github username. So now, every time I push, my changes will get uploaded to Github. The second line renames the branch from “master” to “main”. You are of course free to do so. I don’t like changing the defaults from Git, so I will keep using the name “master”. The last command pushes our changes to the “main” branch (but we need to change “main” to “master”).\nLet’s do just that:\nowner@localhost ➤ git remote add origin git@github.com:rap4all/housing.git\nThis produces no output. We’re now ready to push:\nowner@localhost ➤ git push -u origin master\nand it fails:\nERROR: Permission to rap4all/housing.git denied to b-rodrigues.\nfatal: Could not read from remote repository.\n\nPlease make sure you have the correct access rights\nand the repository exists.\nThe reason is quite simple: Github has absolutely no idea who we are! Remember, if the repository is public, anyone can clone it. But that doesn’t mean that anyone can simply push code to the repo! This means that we need a way to tell Github that we are the owner of the repository. For this, we need a way to log in securely, and we will do so using a public/private RSA encryption key pair. The idea is quite simple; we are going to generate two files on our computer. These two files form a public/private key pair. We are going to upload the public key to Github; and every time we want to interact with Github, Github will check the public key against the private key that we keep on our machine (never, ever, send the private key to anyone). If they match, Github knows that we are who we claim to be and will let us push to the repository. This is why we switched from https to ssh before. https would allow us to log in by typing a password each time we push (but actually, not anymore, since password login was turned off some years ago). It is much easier to not have to log in manually and let our key pair do the job for us.\nLet’s generate a public/private RSA key pair. Open a terminal on Linux or macOS, or Git Bash on Windows and run the following command:\nowner@localhost ➤ ssh-keygen\nThe following lines will appear in your terminal:\nGenerating public/private rsa key pair.\nEnter file in which to save the key (/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa): \nSimply leave this empty and press enter. This next message now appears:\nEnter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): \nLeave it empty as well. Entering a passphrase is not really needed, since the ssh key pair itself will deal with the login. In some situations, a passphrase might be useful if you’re worried that someone might get physical access to your machine and push code by impersonating you. But if you work with such sensitive data and code that this is a real worry, maybe don’t use Github?\nSo once you pressed enter, you get asked to confirm the passphrase:\nEnter same passphrase again: \nHere again, simply leave it empty and press enter on your keyboard. Once this is done, you should see this:\nYour identification has been saved in /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa\nYour public key has been saved in /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\nThe key fingerprint is:\nSHA256:tPZnR7qdN06mV53Mc36F3mASIyD55ktQJFBAVqJXNQw owner@localhost\nThe key's randomart image is:\n+---[RSA 3072]----+\n|   .*=E*=.       |\n|   o o.oo.. .    |\n|  . .  o.  o o   |\n|   .  ..o.  . o  |\n|       +S    o.+.|\n|       .o.   o.o*|\n|       . o. + +=*|\n|        .  o ++*=|\n|            ..=oo|\n+----[SHA256]-----+\nIf now you go to the specified path on the first line (so in our case /home/user/.ssh/ you should see two files, id_rsa and id_rsa.pub, the private and public keys respectively. We’re almost done: what you need to do now is copy the contents of the id_rsa.pub file to Github.\nGo to your profile settings:\n\n\n\nClick on your user profile’s image in the top-right corner.\n\n\nAnd then click on “SSH and GPG keys”:\n\n\n\nGo to your user settings and choose ‘SSH and GPG keys’.\n\n\nand then click on “New SSH key”. Name this key (it’s a good idea to write something that makes recognizing the computer that generated the key easy) and paste the contents of id_rsa.pub in the text box and click on “add SSH key”:\n\n\n\nCopy the contents of the public key here.\n\n\nWe can now go back to our terminal and try to push again:\nowner@localhost ➤ git push -u origin master\nThe following message gets printed:\nThe authenticity of host 'github.com (140.82.121.3)' can't be established.\nED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:+DiY3wvvV6TuJJhbpZisF/zLDA0zPMSvHdkr4UvCOqU.\nThis key is not known by any other names\nAre you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?\nType yes and then you should see the following:\nEnumerating objects: 10, done.\nCounting objects: 100% (10/10), done.\nDelta compression using up to 4 threads\nCompressing objects: 100% (9/9), done.\nWriting objects: 100% (10/10), 2.77 KiB | 2.77 MiB/s, done.\nTotal 10 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0\nremote: Resolving deltas: 100% (2/2), done.\nTo github.com:rap4all/housing.git\n * [new branch]      master -&gt; master\nBranch 'master' set up to track remote branch 'master' from 'origin'.\nAnd we’re done! Our commits are now safely backed up on Github. If we go to our repository’s main page, we should see the following:\n\n\n\nFinally!"

If you use another machine for development, you will need to generate another RSA key pair on that machine and add the public key to Github. If you use another code hosting platform, you can use the same RSA key pair, but will need to add the public key to this other code hosting platform. You can even use the same key pair as a passwordless authentication method for ssh (for example to log into a server, but this is outside the scope of this book). Before continuing we are going to take a little tour of Github.\n\n\n\nYou repository’s landing page.\n\n\nOnce you’re on your repository’s landing page you see the same files and folders as in the root directory of the project on your computer. In our case here, we see our two files. Github suggests that we add a README file; we are going to ignore this for now. Take a closer look at the menu at the top, below your repository’s name:\n\n\n\nSeveral options to choose from.\n\n\nMost important for our needs is the “Issues”, “Pull requests”, “Actions” and “Settings” tab.\nIn the next chapter we are going to learn about pull requests which are essential for collaborating using Git and Github.com. We will learn about the “Actions” tab in the second part of the book.\nSo let’s start with “Settings”.\n\n\n\nChoose the ‘Settings’ tab.\n\n\nThere are many options that you can choose from, but what’s important for our purposes is the “Collaborators” option. This is where you can invite people to contribute to the repository. People that are invited in this way can directly push to the repository. Let’s invite the author of this book:\n\n\n\nFollow along to add a collaborator.\n\n\nStart by typing the person’s Github username. You can also invite collaborators by providing their email address.\n\n\n\nLook for your collaborators.\n\n\nThen click on the user’s profile and he or she should get an invitation by email.\nThis is what it looks like from the perspective of Bruno’s account now:\n\n\n\nBruno can now push as if he owned the repository.\n\n\nIt’s important to understand the distinction between inviting someone to contribute to the repository and have someone from outside the project contribute. We are going to explore these two scenarios in the next section, but before that, let’s see what the “Issues” tab is about.\nIf the repository is public, anyone can open an issue to either submit a bug, or suggest some ideas, and if the repository is private, only invited collaborators can do this.\nLet’s open an issue to illustrate how this works:\n\n\n\nClick on ‘New issue’ in the ‘Issues’ tab of your project.\n\n\nYou will land on this interface:\n\n\n\nWrite what the issue’s about here.\n\n\nGive a nice title to the issue (1), add a thorough description (2), (optionally) assign it to someone (3) and (optionally) add a label to it (4), finally click on “Submit new issue” (5) to submit the issue:\n\n\n\nTry to provide as many details as possible.\n\n\nSometimes issues don’t need to be very long, and act more as reminders than anything else. For example here, the owner of the repository didn’t have the time to add a Readme, but didn’t want to forget to add one later on. The author assigned the issue to Bruno: so it’ll be Bruno’s job to add the Readme. Issue-driven project management is a very valid strategy when working asynchronously and in a decentralized fashion.\nIf you encountered a bug and want to open an issue, it is very important that you provide a minimal, reproducible example (MRE). MREs are snippets of code that can be run very easily by someone other than yourself and which produce the bug reliably. Interestingly, if you understand what makes an MRE minimal and reproducible, you understand what will make our pipelines reproducible as well. So what’s important for an MRE?\nFirst, the code needs to be self-contained. For example, if some data is required you need to provide the data. If the data is sensitive, you need to think about the bug in greater detail: is the bug due to the structure of the data, or does the bug manifest itself on any kind of data? If that’s the case, use some of the built-in datasets to R (iris, mtcars, etc) for your MRE.\nDoes your MRE require extra packages to run? Then make this as clear as possible, and not only provide the package names, but also their versions (it is a good idea to copy and paste the output of sessionInfo() at the end of the issue).\nFinally, does your example depend on some object defined in the global state? If yes, you also need to provide the code to create this object.\nThe bar you need to set for an MRE is as follows: bar needed package dependencies that may need to be installed beforehand, people that try to help you should be able to run your script by simply copy-and-pasting it into an R console. Any other manipulation that you require from them is unacceptable: remember that in open source development, developers very often work during their free time, and don’t owe you tech support! And even if they did, it is always a good idea to make it as easy as possible for them to help you, because it simply increases the likelihood that they will actually help.\nAlso, writing an MRE can usually make you actually debug the code yourself. Just like in rubber duck debugging, the fact of simply trying to explain the problem can lead to finding what’s wrong. But by writing an MRE, you’re also reducing the problem into its most basic parts, and removing everything unnecessary. By doing so, you might realize that what you thought was a bug of the library was maybe rather a problem between the keyboard and the chair.\nSo don’t underestimate the usefulness of creating high-quality MREs for your issues! One package that can assist you with this is {reprex} (read about it here)."

    "section": "5.1 Collaborating as a team",
    "text": "5.1 Collaborating as a team\n\n5.1.1 TBD basics\nRemember the issue we opened and assigned to Bruno? Bruno will now take care of this issue by adding a Readme file. This will also be the opportunity to introduce trunk-based development. The idea of trunk-based development is simple; team members should work on separate branches to add features or fix bugs, and then merge their branch to the “trunk” (in our case the master branch) to add their changes back to the main code-base. And this process should happen quickly, ideally every day, or as soon as some code is ready. When a lot of work accumulates in a branch for several days or weeks, merging it back to the master branch can be very painful. So by working in short-lived branches, if conflicts arise, they can be dealt with quickly. This also makes code review much easier, because the reviewer only needs to review little bits of code at a time. If instead long-lived branches with a lot of code changes get merged, reviewing all the changes and solving the conflicts that could arise would be a lot of work. To avoid this, it is best to merge every day or each time a piece of code is added, and, very importantly, this code does not break the whole project (we will be using unit tests for this later).\nSo in summary: to avoid a lot of pain by merging branches that moved away too much from the trunk, we will create branches, add our code, and merge them to the trunk as soon as possible. As soon as possible can mean several things, but usually this means as soon as a feature was added, a bug was fixed, or as soon as we added some code that does not break the whole project, even if the feature we wanted to add is not done yet. The philosophy is that if merging fails, it should fail as early as possible. Early failures are easy to deal with.\nOur aim should be to provide a functioning project to anyone cloning the master branch anytime (but still offer a simple way to install a point release of the project).\nSo, back to our issue. First, Bruno needs to clone the repository:\nbruno@computer ➤ git clone git@github.com:rap4all/housing.git\nTo add the feature, Bruno will now create a new branch by using the git checkout command with the -b flag:\nbruno@computer ➤ git checkout -b \"add_readme\"\nThe project automatically switches to the new branch:\nSwitched to a new branch 'add_readme'\nWe can also run git status to double-check:\nbruno@computer ➤ git status\nOn branch add_readme\nnothing to commit, working tree clean\nBruno adds a file called README.md and adds the following text to it:\n# Housing data for Luxembourg\n\nThese scripts for the R programming language download nominal\nhousing prices from the *Observatoire de l'Habitat* and\ntidy them up into a flat data frame.\n\n- save_data.R: downloads, cleans, and creates data frames from the data\n- analysis.R: creates plots of the data\nLet’s save this and run git status to see what happened:\nbruno@computer ➤ git status\nGit tells Bruno that the README.md file is not being tracked:\nOn branch add_readme\nUntracked files:\n  (use \"git add &lt;file&gt;...\" to include in what will be committed)\n        README.md\n\nnothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track)\nSo next Bruno is going to track it and push the changes. Also, Bruno is going to use a neat trick when pushing: because Bruno is working on fixing an issue, it would be great if he could close it as he pushes the fix. This is possible by referencing the issue number in the commit message:\nbruno@computer ➤ git add .\nbruno@computer ➤ git commit -m \"fixed #1\"\n#1 refers to the number of the issue (it’s the first issue that was opened in the repository). So by referencing this issue with its number in the commit message and pushing, the issue gets automatically closed when Bruno pushes:\nbruno@computer ➤ git push origin add_readme\nAs you can see from the command above, Bruno pushes to “add_readme”, the branch he opened to solve the issue, not “master”. If he tried to push to “master” a message saying that “master” is up-to-date would get printed. Let’s see the output of pushing to “add_readme”:\nEnumerating objects: 4, done.\nCounting objects: 100% (4/4), done.\nDelta compression using up to 12 threads\nCompressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.\nWriting objects: 100% (3/3), 501 bytes | 501.00 KiB/s, done.\nTotal 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0\nremote:\nremote: Create a pull request for 'add_readme' on GitHub by visiting:\nremote:      https://github.com/rap4all/housing/pull/new/add_readme\nremote:\nTo github.com:rap4all/housing.git\n * [new branch]      add_readme -&gt; add_readme\nGit tells us that Bruno now needs to create a pull request. What is that? Well, if we want to merge our branch back to the trunk, we need to do so by using a pull request. Let’s see what Bruno sees on Github:\n\n\n\nBruno sees that the ‘add_readme’ branch has been recently updated.\n\n\nBruno can now decide to continue working on this branch, or, since the purpose of this branch was only to add the Readme file, decide instead to do a pull request.\nBy clicking on the “Compare & pull request” button Bruno now sees this:\n\n\n\nThis screen makes it easy to see what changed.\n\n\nBruno can leave a comment, and see what changed (in this case, a single file was added) and most importantly, add a reviewer if needed:\n\n\n\nLet boss decide if this is good enough.\n\n\nThis is what Bruno sees now:\n\n\n\nGithub tells us that this branch can safely be merged.\n\n\nBruno requested the review, but Github tells us that the branch can safely be merged. This is because we added a file and did not touch anything else, and no one else worked on the project while Bruno was working. So there are no risks of conflicts arising.\nLet’s see what the owner now sees. The project owner should have gotten a notification to review the pull request:\n\n\n\nThe owner was notified to review the pull request.\n\n\nBy clicking on the notification, the owner gets taken to this view:\n\n\n\nTime to review the pull request.\n\n\nHere, the reviewer can check the commit, the files that were changed, and see if there are any conflicts between this code and the code base on the master (or trunk) branch. Github also tells us two interesting things: the owner can add a rule that states that any pull request must be approved, and also that continuous integration has not been set up (we are going to see what this means in the second part of this book).\nLet’s go ahead and add a rule forcing each pull request to be approved. By clicking on “Add rule”, the following screen appears:\n\n\n\nChoose how to protect the master branch.\n\n\nBy clicking the first option, more sub-options appear:\n\n\n\nReviews are now required.\n\n\nBy choosing these options, the owner can basically enforce trunk-based development (well, collaborators still have to submit pull requests frequently enough though, because if they don’t, we can be in a situation where merging can be very difficult).\nLet’s choose one last option: by scrolling down, it’s possible to select the option “Do not allow bypassing the above settings”. This makes sure that even administrations (the owners of the project) must abide by the same rules.\nLet’s go back to the pull request. We can see now that a review is required:\n\n\n\nTime to review.\n\n\nSo now the owner actually has to go and see the files that were changed:\n\n\n\nCheck the code and add comments if needed.\n\n\nIt’s possible to add comments to single lines if needed:\n\n\n\nIt’s possible to add comments to lines.\n\n\nBy clicking on the plus sign, a box appears and it’s possible to leave a comment. In this case, everything is fine, so the owner is going to click on the “Viewed” button:\n\n\n\nGood job!\n\n\nThen, by clicking on “Review changes”, it’s possible to either add a general comment, approve the pull request, or request changes that must be addressed before merging. Let’s go ahead and approve:\n\n\n\nNothing to complain about.\n\n\nBy submitting the review, the reviewer is taken back to the issue:\n\n\n\nWe’re done, we can merge the pull request.\n\n\nThe reviewer can now merge the pull request by clicking on the “Merge pull request” button. Github even suggests we delete the branch, which has served its purpose:\n\n\n\nLet’s get rid of this branch.\n\n\nLet’s delete it (it’s always possible to restore it).\n\n\n5.1.2 Handling conflicts\nAs mentioned in the previous chapter, Git makes it easy to handle conflicts. Well, let’s be clear; even with Git, it can sometimes be very tricky to resolve conflicts. But you should know that when solving a conflict with Git is difficult, this usually means that it would be impossible to do any other way, and would inevitably result in someone having to reconcile the files by hand. What makes handling conflicts easier with Git though, is that Git is able to tell you where you can find clashes on a per-line basis. So for instance, if you change the first ten lines of a script, and I change the next ten lines, there would be no conflict, and Git will automatically merge both our contributions into a single file. Other tools, like Dropbox, would fail in a situation like this, because these tools can only handle conflicts on a per-file basis. The same file was changed by two different persons? Regardless of where these changes happened, you now have a conflict to deal with on your hands… and worse, you don’t even know where the conflicts are in the file! You will need to scan the two resulting copies of the file by hand. Git, in the case where the same lines were changed, highlights them very clearly so that you can quickly find them and deal with the problems.\nWe will see all of this in the coming sections.\nSo how do conflicts happen? Let’s imagine the following scenario. Both Bruno and the project owner create branches, and edit the same file. Perhaps they talked over the phone and decided to add a feature or correct a bug. Perhaps they decided that it wasn’t worth opening an issue on Github and assign someone to do it. After all, they discussed this on the phone and decided that Bruno should do it. Or was it the owner who needed to solve the issue? No one remembers now. Either way, they both did, and changed the same file, so a conflict will ensue.\nFirst, Bruno needs to switch back to the master branch on his computer:\nbruno@computer ➤ git checkout master\nSwitched to branch 'master'\nYour branch is behind 'origin/master' by 2 commits, and can be fast-forwarded.\n  (use \"git pull\" to update your local branch)\nGit tells us to update the code on our computer by running git pull. We use git push to upload code to Github, and use git pull to download code from Github. Let’s run it and see what happens:\nbruno@computer ➤ git pull\nUpdating b7f82ee..c774ebf\nFast-forward\n README.md | 7 +++++++\n 1 file changed, 7 insertions(+)\n create mode 100644 README.md\nFiles on Bruno’s computer have been updated. The owner of the project (called owner, remember?) can do the same and will see the same. Now, Bruno creates a new branch to work on the new feature:\nbruno@computer ➤ git checkout -b add_cool_feature\nAnd the project owner also creates a new branch:\nowner@localhost ➤ git checkout -b add_nice_feature\nThey now edit the same file, analysis.R. Bruno added this function:\n\nmake_plot &lt;- function(country_level_data,\n                      commune_level_data,\n                      commune){\n\n  filtered_data &lt;- commune_level_data %&gt;%\n    filter(locality == commune)\n\n  data_to_plot &lt;- bind_rows(\n    country_level_data,\n    filtered_data\n  )\n\n  ggplot(data_to_plot) +\n    geom_line(aes(y = pl_m2,\n                  x = year,\n                  group = locality,\n                  colour = locality))\n}\n\nThis way, Bruno could delete the repeating code and create plots like this:\n\nlux_plot &lt;- make_plot(country_level_data,\n                      commune_level_data,\n                      communes[1])\n\n\n# Esch sur Alzette\n\nesch_plot &lt;- make_plot(country_level_data,\n                       commune_level_data,\n                       communes[2])\n\n# and so on...\n\nThe end effect is the same, but by using this function, the code is now shorter, and clearer. Also, if someone wants to change, say, the theme of the plot, now this only needs to be changed in one place and not for each commune. Now, what did the owner change? The owner started by removing the line that loaded the {purrr} package, as no function from the package was used in the script, and then also changed every %&gt;% to |&gt;. It seems that much more than just who would make the changes got lost in translation… Anyways, both now push their changes to their respective branches. This is Bruno:\nbruno@computer ➤ git add .\nbruno@computer ➤ git commit -m \"make_plot() for plotting\"\nbruno@computer ➤ git push origin add_cool_feature\nEnumerating objects: 5, done.\nCounting objects: 100% (5/5), done.\nDelta compression using up to 12 threads\nCompressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.\nWriting objects: 100% (3/3), 647 bytes | 647.00 KiB/s, done.\nTotal 3 (delta 1), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0\nremote: Resolving deltas: 100% (1/1), completed with 1 local object.\nremote:\nremote: Create a pull request for 'add_cool_feature' on GitHub by visiting:\nremote:      https://github.com/rap4all/housing/pull/new/add_cool_feature\nremote:\nTo github.com:rap4all/housing.git\n * [new branch]      add_cool_feature -&gt; add_cool_feature\nand this is the owner:\nowner@localhost ➤ git add .\nowner@localhost ➤ git commit -m \"cleanup\"\nowner@localhost ➤ git push origin add_sweet_feature\nEnumerating objects: 5, done.\nCounting objects: 100% (5/5), done.\nDelta compression using up to 4 threads\nCompressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.\nWriting objects: 100% (3/3), 449 bytes | 449.00 KiB/s, done.\nTotal 3 (delta 1), reused 0 (delta 0)\nremote: Resolving deltas: 100% (1/1), completed with 1 local object.\nremote:\nremote: Create a pull request for 'add_sweet_feature' on GitHub by visiting:\nremote:      https://github.com/rap4all/housing/pull/new/add_sweet_feature\nremote:\nTo github.com:rap4all/housing.git\n * [new branch]      add_sweet_feature -&gt; add_sweet_feature\nSo, let’s think about what just happened: two developers changed the same file, analysis.R, in two separate branches. These two branches need to be merged back to the trunk.\nSo Bruno does a pull request:\n\n\n\nBruno opens a pull request after finishing his changes.\n\n\nFirst, Bruno selects the feature branch (1), then clicks on “Contribute” (2) and then “Open pull request” (3). Bruno gets taken to this screen:\n\n\n\nNo conflicts, for now…\n\n\nNow Bruno can click on “Create pull request”, but remember, because reviews are required, automatic merging is disabled.\nIf now we go see what happens from the project owner’s side of things, first of all, there’s now a notification for a pending review:\n\n\n\nNew review pending.\n\n\nBy clicking on it, the project owner can review the pull request and decide what to do with it. So at this point, the owner did not open a pull request for the feature he or she worked on yet. And maybe that’s a good thing, because now the project owner can see that the changes that Bruno made on the file will conflict with the project owner’s changes.\nSo how to move forward? Simple: the project owner can decide to approve the pull request, which will merge Bruno’s changes into the master branch (or the trunk). Then, instead of opening a pull request for merging his or her changes into trunk, which will cause a conflict, the project owner can instead merge the changes from the trunk into his or her feature branch. This will also create a conflict, but now the project owner can easily deal with it on his or her machine, and then push a new commit with both changes integrated gracefully. The image below illustrates this workflow:\n\n\n\nConflict solving with trunk-based development.\n\n\nFirst step, the owner reviews and approves Bruno’s pull request:\n\n\n\nFirst, let’s approve the changes.\n\n\nThe pull request can get merged and Bruno’s feature branch deleted. Now, it wouldn’t make sense for the project owner to create a pull request to merge his or her changes. They would conflict with what Bruno did. So the project owner goes back to his or her computer and essentially updates the code in his or her feature branch by merging master into it.\nSo, the project owner checks that he or she is working on the feature branch:\nowner@localhost ➤ git status\nOn branch add_sweet_feature\nnothing to commit, working tree clean\nOk, so now let’s get the updated code from master, by pulling from master:\nowner@localhost ➤ git pull origin master\nThe owner now sees this:\nremote: Enumerating objects: 6, done.\nremote: Counting objects: 100% (6/6), done.\nremote: Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.\nremote: Total 4 (delta 1), reused 3 (delta 1), pack-reused 0\nUnpacking objects: 100% (4/4), 1.23 KiB | 418.00 KiB/s, done.\nFrom github.com:rap4all/housing\n * branch            master     -&gt; FETCH_HEAD\n   c774ebf..a43c68f  master     -&gt; origin/master\nAuto-merging analysis.R\nCONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in analysis.R\nAutomatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.\nGit detects that there’s some conflicts and tells the owner to fix them, and then commit the results. So let’s open analysis.R and see how it looks (you can view the file online on this link1. First of all, you will see Git deals with conflicts on a per-line basis. So each line that the owner changed that does not conflict with Bruno’s change gets immediately updated to reflect the owner’s changes. For example, remember that the owner removed the line that loaded the {purrr} package? This line was also removed by pulling the changes from master into the feature branch. Also, you should notice that every %&gt;% was changed into |&gt; as well. These two changes happened without any issues.\nThen, you should understand what happens when a conflict gets detected on some lines. For example, this is the first conflict you should see:\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD\nfiltered_data &lt;- commune_level_data |&gt;\n  filter(locality == communes[1])\n=======\n  filtered_data &lt;- commune_level_data %&gt;%\n    filter(locality == commune)\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a43c68f5596563ffca33b3729451bffc762782c3\nWe see how the lines look on the owner’s computer and how they look in the master branch (or trunk). The lines between &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD and ======= are the lines in the owner’s feature branch. The lines between ======= and &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a43c68f5596563ffca33b3729451bffc762782c3 are how they look in the master branch (or trunk). This very long chain of characters that starts with a43c68f is the hash of the commit from which these lines come from.\nSo this makes things quite easy; one simply needs to remove the outdated code, and then commit and push the fixed file! The project owner only needs to remove &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD and ======= and what’s between these lines, as well as the lines that show the hash commit. The project owner can now commit and push the changes, open a pull request, ask Bruno to review the changes one last time and merge everything back to master.\n\n\n\nThe conflict has been gracefully solved.\n\n\nIn (1) we see the commit that deals with the conflict, in (2) the owner asks Bruno for a review and then in (3) we see that Bruno reviewed and approved. Finally, the pull request can be merged (4) and the feature branch deleted.\n\n\n5.1.3 Make sure you blame the right person\nIf many people contribute to a single project, it might sometimes be difficult to know who changed what and when exactly. This is where the git blame command is useful. If you want to know who changed the file called analysis.R for example, simply run:\nowner@localhost ➤ git blame analysis.R\nand you will see a detailed history, line by line, with the user name of the contributors and a date stamp:\nb7f82ee1 (Bruno   2023-02-05 18:03:37 +0100 24) #Let’s also compute it...\nb7f82ee1 (Bruno   2023-02-05 18:03:37 +0100 25) \n55804ccb (Owner   2023-02-11 22:33:20 +0000 26) country_level_data &lt;- ...\n55804ccb (Owner   2023-02-11 22:33:20 +0000 27)   mutate(p0 = ifelse(y...\nWe can see that Bruno edited lines 24 and 25 on the 5th of February as part of the commit with the hash b7f82ee1, while the owner of the repository changed lines 26 and 27 on the 11th of February as part of the commit with the hash 55804ccb.\nTake advantage of git blame to have a clear overview of each file’s changes.\n\n\n5.1.4 Simplified trunk-based development\nThe workflow that we showed here may seem a bit too rigid for smaller teams (below 4 or 5 contributors). It is possible to adopt a simplified version of trunk-based development, where contributors don’t have to open pull requests to merge their feature branches into the trunk, and no reviewer is needed. In cases like this, Git forces you to pull changes if someone already merged his or her feature branch into the trunk before you could. This way, when pulling, conflicts (if any) arise at that point. It is then your responsibility to solve the conflicts (and this works just like in the previous section) and then commit and push the commits with the conflicts resolved. Another contributor who then wishes to merge his or her feature branch into the trunk will have to pull again, ensuring that conflicts get resolved before they can merge. If no conflicts arise (for example, you both worked on different files, or on different lines of the same files), then no resolution is needed and the feature branch can be merged into master.\n\n\n5.1.5 Conclusion\nThe main ideas of trunk-based development are:\n\nEach contributor opens a new branch to develop a feature or fix a bug, and works alone on his or her own little branch;\nAt the end of the day at the latest (or a previously agreed upon duration), branches need all to get merged;\nConflicts need to be taken care of at that point;\nIf adding a feature would take more time than just one day, then the task needs to be split in a manner that small contributions can be merged daily. In the beginning, these contributions can be simple placeholders that will be gradually enriched with functioning code until the feature is successfully implemented. This strategy is called branching by abstraction;\nThe master branch (or trunk) contains always working, production-grade code;\nTo enforce discipline, it might be worth it to make opening pull requests mandatory for merging back to the trunk, and require a review."

For example, maybe we use an R package and notice a bug, and want to propose a fix. Or maybe we simply spotted a typo in the README of said package, and want to propose a correction. Whatever it may be, if the repository is public, anyone can propose a fix. For example, consider this repository:\n\n\n\nA public repository.\n\n\nThis repository contains code written by a fellow called “rap4all”, and Bruno uses this code daily. However, Bruno notices a typo in the readme, and wants to propose a fix.\nFirst, Bruno visits the repository on Github (since it’s a public repository, anyone can view it online) and creates a fork:\n\n\n\nBruno needs to create a fork of the repository.\n\n\nForking creates a copy of the repository in Bruno’s account:\n\n\n\nBruno goes ahead with forking.\n\n\nBruno now sees the fork on his account as well:\n\n\n\nBruno’s fork.\n\n\nSo now, Bruno can clone this repository and work on it, because he is working on a copy of the repository that he owns. Anything Bruno does on this copy will not affect the original repository.\nbruno@computer ➤ git clone git@github.com:b-rodrigues/my_cool_project.git \nBruno now fixes the typo in the README.md file, commits and pushes to his fork:\n\n\n\nBruno fixed the typo in his fork.\n\n\nAs you can see, Bruno’s fork is now ahead of the original repo by one commit. By clicking on “Contribute”, Bruno can open a pull request to propose his fix to the original repository.\nThis pull request will be opened over at the original repository:\n\n\n\nBruno opens a pull request to contribute his fix upstream.\n\n\nWhat does the owner of the original repository, “rap4all”, see? The pull request Bruno opened is now in the original repository’s “Pull request” menu, and the owner can check what the contribution is, if it breaks code or not, etc. This is essentially the same workflow as the one presented before in trunk-based development with pull requests and reviews before merging (minus the forking of the repository).\n\n\n\nThe owner of the original repository can now accept Bruno’s fix.\n\n\nBy merging the fix, the owner can now benefit from a grammatically correct Readme file as well:\n\n\n\nThe beauty of open source."

    "section": "6.1 Introduction",
    "text": "6.1 Introduction\nRemember that the philosophy of part one of this book is “don’t repeat yourself”. In this chapter we will see how we can reduce the amount of code as much as possible. In the previous chapter we’ve seen how Bruno was able to get rid of many lines of code (that were all the same) by writing a single function:\n\nmake_plot &lt;- function(country_level_data,\n                      commune_level_data,\n                      commune){\n\n  filtered_data &lt;- commune_level_data %&gt;%\n    filter(locality == commune)\n\n  data_to_plot &lt;- bind_rows(\n    country_level_data,\n    filtered_data\n  )\n\n  ggplot(data_to_plot) +\n    geom_line(aes(y = pl_m2,\n                  x = year,\n                  group = locality,\n                  colour = locality))\n}\n\nNow we are going to go one step further and not only learn how to write good functions, but also how we can push the concept of “not repeating oneself” to the extreme by using higher-order functions and function factories.\nYou are very likely already familiar with at least two elements of functional programming: functions and lists. But functional programming is a complete programming paradigm, so using functional programming is more than simply using functions and lists (which you can use with other programming paradigms as well).\nFunctional programming is a paradigm that relies exclusively on the evaluation of functions to achieve the desired result. If you have already written your own functions in the past, what follows will not be very new. But in order to write a good functional program, the functions that you write and evaluate have to have certain properties. Before discussing these properties, let’s start with state.\n\n6.1.1 The state of your program\nLet’s suppose that you start a fresh R session, and immediately run this line:\n\nls()\n\nIf you did not modify any of R’s configuration files that get automatically loaded on startup, you should see the following:\n\ncharacter(0)\n\nLet’s suppose that now you load some data:\n\ndata(mtcars)\n\nand define a variable a:\n\na &lt;- 1\n\nRunning ls() now shows the following:\n\n[1] \"a\"      \"mtcars\"\n\nYou have just altered the state of your program. You can think of the state as a box that holds everything that gets defined by the user and is accessible at any time. Let’s now define a simple function that prints a sentence:\n\nf &lt;- function(name){\n  print(paste0(name, \" likes lasagna\"))\n}\n\nf(\"Bruno\")\n\nand here’s the output:\n\n[1] \"Bruno likes lasagna\"\n\nLet’s run ls() again:\n\n[1] \"a\"      \"f\"      \"mtcars\"\n\nFunction f() is now listed there as well. This function has two nice properties:\n\nFor a given input, it always returns exactly the same output. So f(\"Bruno\") will always return “Bruno likes lasagna”.\nWhen running this function, the state of the program does not get altered in any way.\n\n\n\n6.1.2 Predictable functions\nLet’s now define another function called g(), which does not have the same properties as f(). First, let’s define a function which does not always return the same output given a particular input:\n\ng &lt;- function(name){\n  food &lt;- sample(c(\"lasagna\", \"cassoulet\", \"feijoada\"), 1)\n  print(paste0(name, \" likes \", food))\n}\n\nFor the same input, “Bruno”, this function now produces (potentially) a different output:\n\ng(\"Bruno\")\n[1] \"Bruno likes lasagna\"\n\n\ng(\"Bruno\")\n[1] \"Bruno likes feijoada\"\n\nAnd now let’s consider function h() that modifies the state of the program:\n\nh &lt;- function(name){\n  food &lt;- sample(c(\"lasagna\", \"cassoulet\", \"feijoada\"), 1)\n\n  if(exists(\"food_list\")){\n    food_list &lt;&lt;- append(food_list, food)\n  } else {\n    food_list &lt;&lt;- append(list(), food)\n  }\n\n  print(paste0(name, \" likes \", food))\n}\n\nThis function uses the &lt;&lt;- operator. This operator saves definitions that are made inside the body of functions (the body of a function are all the instructions that go between the curly braces) in the global environment. Before calling this function, run ls() again. You should see the same objects as before, plus the new functions we’ve defined:\n\n[1] \"a\"       \"f\"        \"g\"         \"h\"         \"mtcars\"\n\nLet’s now run h() once:\n\nh(\"Bruno\")\n[1] \"Bruno likes feijoada\"\n\nAnd now ls() again:\n\n[1] \"a\"       \"f\"       \"food_list\" \"g\"       \"h\"       \"mtcars\"\n\nRunning h() did two things: it printed the message, but also created a variable called “food_list” in the global environment with the following contents:\n\nfood_list\n\n\n[[1]]\n[1] \"feijoada\"\n\nLet’s run h() again:\n\nh(\"Bruno\")\n[1] \"Bruno likes cassoulet\"\n\nand let’s check the contents of “food_list”:\n\nfood_list\n\n\n[[1]]\n[1] \"feijoada\"\n\n[[2]]\n[1] \"cassoulet\"\n\nIf you keep running h(), this list will continue growing. Let me say that I hesitated to show you this; this is because if you didn’t know &lt;&lt;-, you might find the example above useful. But while useful, it is quite dangerous as well. Generally, we want to avoid using functions that change the state as much as possible because these functions are unpredictable, especially if randomness is involved. It is much safer to define h() like this instead:\n\nh &lt;- function(name, food_list = list()){\n\n  food &lt;- sample(c(\"lasagna\", \"cassoulet\", \"feijoada\"), 1)\n\n  food_list &lt;- append(food_list, food)\n\n  print(paste0(name, \" likes \", food))\n\n  food_list\n}\n\nThe difference now is that we made food_list the second argument of the function. Also, we defined it as being optional by writing:\n\nfood_list = list()\n\nThis means that if we omit this argument, the empty list will get used by default. This avoids the users from having to manually specify it.\nWe can call it like this:\n\nfood_list &lt;- h(\"Bruno\", food_list) # since food_list is\n                                   # already defined,  we don't\n                                   # need to start with an empty list\n\n\n[1] \"Bruno likes feijoada\"\n\nWe save the output back to food_list. Let’s now check its contents:\n\nfood_list\n\n\n[[1]]\n[1] \"feijoada\"\n\n[[2]]\n[1] \"cassoulet\"\n\n[[3]]\n[1] \"feijoada\"\n\nThe only thing that we now still need to deal with is the fact that the food item gets chosen randomly. I’m going to show you the simple way of dealing with this, but later in this chapter we are going to use the {withr} package for situations like this. Let’s redefine h() one last time:\n\nh &lt;- function(name, food_list = list(), seed = 123){\n\n  # We set the seed, making sure that we get the same\n  # selection of food for a given seed\n\n  set.seed(seed)\n  food &lt;- sample(c(\"lasagna\", \"cassoulet\", \"feijoada\"), 1)\n\n  # We now need to unset the seed, because if we don't,\n  # guess what, the seed will stay set for the whole session!\n\n  set.seed(NULL)\n\n  food_list &lt;- append(food_list, food)\n\n  print(paste0(name, \" likes \", food))\n\n  food_list\n}\n\nLet’s now call h() several times with its default arguments:\n\nh(\"Bruno\")\n\n\n[1] \"Bruno likes feijoada\"\n[[1]]\n[1] \"feijoada\"\n\n\nh(\"Bruno\")\n\n\n[1] \"Bruno likes feijoada\"\n[[1]]\n[1] \"feijoada\"\n\n\nh(\"Bruno\")\n\n\n[1] \"Bruno likes feijoada\"\n[[1]]\n[1] \"feijoada\"\n\nAs you can see, every time this function runs, it now outputs the same result. Users can change the seed to have this function output, consistently, another result.\n\n\n6.1.3 Referentially transparent and pure functions\nA referentially transparent function is a function that does not use any variable that is not also one of its inputs. For example, the following function:\n\nbad &lt;- function(x){\n  x + y\n}\n\nis not referentially transparent, because y is not one of the function’s inputs. What happens if you run bad() is that bad() needs to look for y. Because y is not one of its inputs, bad() then looks for it in the global environment. If y is defined there, it then gets used. Defining and using such functions must be avoided at all costs because these functions are unpredictable. For example:\n\ny &lt;- 10\n\nbad &lt;- function(x){\n  x + y\n}\n\nbad(5)\n\nThis will return 15. But if y &lt;- 45 then bad(5) would this time around return 50. It is much safer, and clearer to make y an explicit input of the function instead of having to keep track of y’s value (and it’s so easy to do, why just not do it):\n\ngood &lt;- function(x, y){\n  x + y\n}\n\ngood() is a referentially transparent function; it is much safer than bad(). good() is also a pure function, because it’s a function that does not interact in any way with the global environment. It does not write anything to the global environment, nor requires anything from the global environment. Function h() from the previous section was not pure, because it created an object and wrote it to the global environment (the food_list object). Turns out that pure functions are thus necessarily referentially transparent.\nSo the first lesson in your functional programming journey that you have to remember is to only use pure functions."

    "text": "6.2 Writing good functions\n\n6.2.1 Functions are first-class objects\nIn a functional programming language, functions are first-class objects. Contrary to what the name implies, this means that functions, especially the ones you define yourself, are nothing special. A function is an object like any other, and can thus be manipulated as such. Think of anything that you can do with any object in R, and you can do the same thing with a function. For example, let’s consider the +() function. It takes two numeric objects and returns their sum:\n\n1 + 5.3\n\n[1] 6.3\n\n# or alternatively: `+`(1, 5.3)\n\nYou can replace the numbers with functions that return numbers:\n\nsqrt(1) + log(5.3)\n\n[1] 2.667707\n\n\nIt’s also possible to define a function that explicitly takes another function as an input:\n\nh &lt;- function(number, f){\n  f(number)\n}\n\nYou can call then use h() as a wrapper for f():\n\nh(4, sqrt)\n\n[1] 2\n\nh(10, log10)\n\n[1] 1\n\n\nBecause h() takes another function as an argument, h() is called a higher-order function.\nIf you don’t know how many arguments f(), the function you’re wrapping, has, you can use the ...:\n\nh &lt;- function(number, f, ...){\n  f(number, ...)\n}\n\n... are simply a placeholder for any potential additional argument that f() might have:\n\nh(c(1, 2, NA, 3), mean, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 2\n\nh(c(1, 2, NA, 3), mean, na.rm = FALSE)\n\n[1] NA\n\n\nna.rm is an argument of mean(). As the developer of h(), I don’t necessarily know what f() might be, but even if I knew what f() would be and knew all its arguments, I might not want to list them all. So I can use ... instead. The following is also possible:\n\nw &lt;- function(...){\n  paste0(\"First argument: \", ..1,\n         \", second argument: \", ..2,\n         \", last argument: \", ..3)\n}\n\nw(1, 2, 3)\n\n[1] \"First argument: 1, second argument: 2, last argument: 3\"\n\n\nIf you want to learn more about ..., type ?dots in an R console.\nBecause functions are nothing special, you can also write functions that return functions. As an illustration, we’ll be writing a function that converts warnings to errors. This can be quite useful if you want your functions to fail early, which often makes debugging easier. For example, try running this:\n\nsqrt(-5)\n\nWarning in sqrt(-5): NaNs produced\n\n\n[1] NaN\n\n\nThis only raises a warning and returns NaN (Not a Number). This can be quite dangerous, especially when working non-interactively, which is what we will be doing a lot later on. It is much better if a pipeline fails early due to an error, than dragging a NaN value. This also happens with sqrt():\n\nsqrt(-10)\n\nWarning in sqrt(-10): NaNs produced\n\n\n[1] NaN\n\n\nSo it could be useful to redefine these functions to raise an error instead, for example like this:\n\nstrict_sqrt &lt;- function(x){\n\n  if(x &lt; 0) stop(\"x is negative\")\n\n  sqrt(x)\n\n}\n\nThis function now throws an error for negative x:\n\nstrict_sqrt(-10)\n\nError in strict_sqrt(-10) : x is negative\nHowever, it can be quite tedious to redefine every function that we need in our pipeline, and remember, we don’t want to repeat ourselves. So, because functions are nothing special, we can define a function that takes a function as an argument, converts any warning thrown by that function into an error, and returns a new function. For example:\n\nstrictly &lt;- function(f){\n  function(...){\n    tryCatch({\n      f(...)\n    },\n    warning = function(warning)stop(\"Can't do that chief\"))\n  }\n}\n\nThis function makes use of tryCatch() which catches warnings raised by an expression (in this example the expression is f(...)) and then raises an error instead with the stop() function. It is now possible to define new functions like this:\n\ns_sqrt &lt;- strictly(sqrt)\n\n\ns_sqrt(-4)\n\nError in value[[3L]](cond) : Can't do that chief\n\ns_log &lt;- strictly(log)\n\n\ns_log(-4)\n\nError in value[[3L]](cond) : Can't do that chief\nFunctions that return functions are called function factories and they’re incredibly useful. I use this so much that I’ve written a package, available on CRAN, called {chronicler}, that does this:\n\ns_sqrt &lt;- chronicler::record(sqrt)\n\n\nresult &lt;- s_sqrt(-4)\n\nresult\n\nNOK! Value computed unsuccessfully:\n---------------\nNothing\n\n---------------\nThis is an object of type `chronicle`.\nRetrieve the value of this object with pick(.c, \"value\").\nTo read the log of this object, call read_log(.c).\n\n\nBecause the expression above resulted in an error, Nothing is returned. Nothing is a special value defined in the {maybe} package (check it out, a very interesting package!). We can then even read a log to see what went wrong:\n\nchronicler::read_log(result)\n\n[1] \"Complete log:\"                                                                                \n[2] \"NOK! sqrt() ran unsuccessfully with following exception: NaNs produced at 2023-05-30 20:38:01\"\n[3] \"Total running time: 0.00127339363098145 secs\"                                                 \n\n\nThe {purrr} package also comes with function factories that you might find useful ({possibly}, {safely} and {quietly}).\nIn part 2 we will also learn about assertive programming, another way of making our functions safer, as an alternative to using function factories.\n\n\n6.2.2 Optional arguments\nIt is possible to make functions’ arguments optional, by using NULL. For example:\n\ng &lt;- function(x, y = NULL){\n  if(is.null(y)){\n    print(\"optional argument y is NULL\")\n    x\n  } else {\n    if(y == 5) print(\"y is present\"); x+y\n  }\n}\n\nCalling g(10) prints the message “Optional argument y is NULL”, and returns 10. Calling g(10, 5) however, prints “y is present” and returns 15. It is also possible to use missing():\n\ng &lt;- function(x, y){\n  if(missing(y)){\n    print(\"optional argument y is missing\")\n    x\n  } else {\n    if(y == 5) print(\"y is present\"); x+y\n  }\n}\n\nI however prefer the first approach, because it is clearer which arguments are optional, which is not the case with the second approach, where you need to read the body of the function.\n\n\n6.2.3 Safe functions\nIt is important that your functions are safe and predictable. You should avoid writing functions that behave like the nchar() base function. Let’s see why this function is not safe:\n\nnchar(\"10000000\")\n\n[1] 8\n\n\nIt returns the expected result of 8. But what if I remove the quotes?\n\nnchar(10000000)\n\n[1] 5\n\n\nWhat is going on here? I’ll give you a hint: simply type 10000000 in the console:\n\n10000000\n\n[1] 1e+07\n\n\n10000000 gets represented as 1e+07 by R. This number in scientific notation gets then converted into the character “1e+07” by nchar(), and this conversion happens silently. nchar() then counts the number of characters, and correctly returns 5. The problem is that it doesn’t make sense to provide a number to a function that expects a character. This function should have returned an error message, or at the very least raised a warning that the number got converted into a character. Here is how you could rewrite nchar() to make it safer:\n\nnchar2 &lt;- function(x, result = 0){\n\n  if(!isTRUE(is.character(x))){\n    stop(paste0(\"x should be of type 'character', but is of type '\",\n                typeof(x), \"' instead.\"))\n  } else if(x == \"\"){\n    result\n  } else {\n    result &lt;- result + 1\n    split_x &lt;- strsplit(x, split = \"\")[[1]]\n    nchar2(paste0(split_x[-1],\n                     collapse = \"\"), result)\n  }\n}\n\nThis function now returns an error message if the input is not a character:\n\nnchar2(10000000)\n\nError in nchar2(10000000) : x should be of type 'character', but is of type 'integer' instead.\nThis section is in a sense an introduction to assertive programming. As mentioned in the section on function factories, we will be learning about assertive programming in greater detail in part 2 of the book.\n\n\n6.2.4 Recursive functions\nYou may have noticed in the last lines of nchar2() (defined above) that nchar2() calls itself. A function that calls itself in its own body is called a recursive function. It is sometimes easier to define a function in its recursive form than in an iterative form. The most common example is the factorial function. However, there is an issue with recursive functions (in the R programming language, other programming languages may not have the same problem, like Haskell): while it is sometimes easier to write a function using a recursive algorithm than an iterative algorithm, like for the factorial function, recursive functions in R are quite slow. Let’s take a look at two definitions of the factorial function, one recursive, the other iterative:\n\nfact_iter &lt;- function(n){\n  result = 1\n  for(i in 1:n){\n    result = result * i\n    i = i + 1\n  }\n  result\n}\n\nfact_recur &lt;- function(n){\n  if(n == 0 || n == 1){\n  result = 1\n  } else {\n    n * fact_recur(n-1)\n  }\n}\n\nUsing the {microbenchmark} package we can benchmark the code:\n\nmicrobenchmark::microbenchmark(\n  fact_recur(50),\n  fact_iter(50)\n)\n\nUnit: microseconds\n           expr    min     lq     mean median      uq    max neval\n fact_recur(50) 21.501 21.701 23.82701 21.901 22.0515 68.902   100\n  fact_iter(50)  2.000  2.101  2.74599  2.201  2.3510 21.000   100\nWe see that the recursive factorial function is 10 times slower than the iterative version. In this particular example it doesn’t make much of a difference, because the functions only take microseconds to run. But if you’re working with more complex functions, this is a problem. If you want to keep using the recursive function and not switch to an iterative algorithm, there are ways to make them faster. The first is called trampolining. I won’t go into details, but if you’re interested, there is an R package that allows you to use trampolining with R, aptly called {trampoline}. Another solution is using the {memoise} package. Again, I won’t go into details. So if you want to use and optimize recursive functions, take a look at these packages.\n\n\n6.2.5 Anonymous functions\nIt is possible to define a function and not give it a name. For example:\n\nfunction(x)(x+1)(10)\n\nSince R version 4.1, there is even a shorthand notation for anonymous functions:\n\n(\\(x)(x+1))(10)\n\nBecause we don’t name them, we cannot reuse them. So why is this useful? Anonymous functions are useful when you need to apply a function somewhere inside a pipe once, and don’t want to define a function just for this. This will become clearer once we learn about lists, but before that, let’s philosophize a bit.\n\n\n6.2.6 The Unix philosophy applied to R\n\nThis is the Unix philosophy: Write programs that do one thing and do it well. Write programs to work together. Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.\n\nDoug McIlroy, in A Quarter Century of Unix1\nWe can take inspiration from the Unix philosophy and rewrite it for our purposes:\nWrite functions that do one thing and do it well. Write functions that work together. Write functions that handle lists, because that is a universal interface.\nStrive for writing simple functions that only perform one task. Don’t hesitate to split a big function into smaller ones. Small functions that only perform one task are easier to maintain, test, document and debug. These smaller functions can then be chained using the |&gt; operator. In other words, it is preferable to have something like:\na |&gt; f() |&gt; g() |&gt; h()\nwhere a is for example a path to a data set, and where f(), g() and h() successively read, clean, and plot the data, than having something like:\nbig_function(a)\nthat does all the steps above in one go.\nThis idea of splitting the problem into smaller chunks, each chunk in turn split into even smaller units that can be handled by functions and then the results of these function combined into a final output is called composition.\nThe advantage of splitting big_function() into f(), g() and h() is that you can eat the elephant one bite at a time, and also reuse these smaller functions in other projects more easily. So what’s important is that you can make small functions work together by sharing a common interface. The list is usually a good candidate for this."

    "section": "6.3 Lists: a powerful data-structure",
    "text": "6.3 Lists: a powerful data-structure\nLists are the second important ingredient of functional programming. In the R philosophy inspired by the UNIX philosophy, I stated that lists are a universal interface in R, so our functions should handle lists. This of course depends on what it is you’re doing. If you need functions to handle numbers, then there’s little value in placing these numbers inside lists. But in practice, you will very likely manipulate objects that are more complex than numbers, and this is where lists come into play.\n\n6.3.1 Lists all the way down\nLists are extremely flexible, and most of the very complex objects classes that you manipulate are actually lists, but just fancier. For example, a data frame is a list:\n\ndata(mtcars)\n\ntypeof(mtcars)\n\n[1] \"list\"\n\n\nA fitted model is a list:\n\nmy_model &lt;- lm(hp ~ mpg, data = mtcars)\n\ntypeof(my_model)\n\n[1] \"list\"\n\n\nA ggplot is a list:\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nmy_plot &lt;- ggplot(data = mtcars) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = hp, x = mpg))\n\ntypeof(my_plot)\n\n[1] \"list\"\n\n\nIt’s lists all the way down, and it’s not a coincidence; it’s because lists are very powerful. So it’s important to know what you can do with lists.\n\n\n6.3.2 Lists can hold many things\nIf you write a function that needs to return many objects, the only solution is to place them inside a list. For example, consider this function:\n\nsqrt_newton &lt;- function(a,\n                        init = 1,\n                        eps = 0.01,\n                        steps = 1){\n\n    stopifnot(a &gt;= 0)\n    while(abs(init**2 - a) &gt; eps){\n        init &lt;- 1/2 *(init + a/init)\n        steps &lt;- steps + 1\n    }\n    list(\n      \"result\" = init,\n      \"steps\" = steps\n    )\n}\n\nThis function returns the square root of a number using Newton’s algorithm, as well as the number of steps, or iterations, it took to reach the solution:\n\nresult_list &lt;- sqrt_newton(1600)\n\nresult_list\n\n$result\n[1] 40\n\n$steps\n[1] 10\n\n\nIt is quite common to print the number of steps to the console instead of returning them. But the issue with a function that prints something to the console instead of returning it, is that such a function is not pure, as it changes something outside of its scope (it prints to the console!). And if you need the information that got printed (for example, if you want to count all the steps it took to run the script from start to finish), it is lost. It gets printed, and that’s it. It is preferable to instead make the function pure by returning everything inside a neat list. It is then possible to separately save these objects if needed:\n\nresult &lt;- result_list$result\n\nresult_steps &lt;- result_list$steps\n\nOr you could define functions that know how to deal with the list:\n\nf &lt;- function(result_list){\n  list(\n    \"result\" = result_list$result * 10,\n    \"steps\" = result_list$steps + 1\n    )\n}\n\nf(result_list)\n\n$result\n[1] 400\n\n$steps\n[1] 11\n\n\nIt all depends on what you want to do. But it is usually better to keep everything neatly inside a list.\nLists can also hold objects of different types:\n\nlist(\n  \"a\" = head(mtcars),\n  \"b\" = ~lm(y ~ x)\n  )\n\n$a\n                   mpg cyl disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb\nMazda RX4         21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.620 16.46  0  1    4    4\nMazda RX4 Wag     21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.875 17.02  0  1    4    4\nDatsun 710        22.8   4  108  93 3.85 2.320 18.61  1  1    4    1\nHornet 4 Drive    21.4   6  258 110 3.08 3.215 19.44  1  0    3    1\nHornet Sportabout 18.7   8  360 175 3.15 3.440 17.02  0  0    3    2\nValiant           18.1   6  225 105 2.76 3.460 20.22  1  0    3    1\n\n$b\n~lm(y ~ x)\n\n\nThe list above has two elements, the first is the head of the mtcars data frame, the second is a formula object. Lists can even hold other lists:\n\nlist(\n  \"a\" = head(mtcars),\n  \"b\" = list(\n    \"c\" = sqrt,\n    \"d\" = my_plot # Remember this ggplot object from before?\n    )\n  )\n\n$a\n                   mpg cyl disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb\nMazda RX4         21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.620 16.46  0  1    4    4\nMazda RX4 Wag     21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.875 17.02  0  1    4    4\nDatsun 710        22.8   4  108  93 3.85 2.320 18.61  1  1    4    1\nHornet 4 Drive    21.4   6  258 110 3.08 3.215 19.44  1  0    3    1\nHornet Sportabout 18.7   8  360 175 3.15 3.440 17.02  0  0    3    2\nValiant           18.1   6  225 105 2.76 3.460 20.22  1  0    3    1\n\n$b\n$b$c\nfunction (x)  .Primitive(\"sqrt\")\n\n$b$d\n\n\n\n\n\nUse this to your advantage.\n\n\n6.3.3 Lists as the cure to loops\nLoops are incredibly useful, and you are likely familiar with them. The problem with loops is that they are a concept from iterative programming, not functional programming, and this is a problem because loops rely on changing the state of your program to run. For example, let’s suppose that you wish to use a for-loop to compute the sum of the first 100 integers:\n\nresult &lt;- 0\n\nfor (i in 1:100){\n  result &lt;- result + i\n}\n\nprint(result)\n\n[1] 5050\n\n\nIf you run ls() now, you should see that there’s a variable i in your global environment. This could cause issues further down in your pipeline if you need to re-use i. Also, writing loops is, in my opinion, quite error prone. But how can we avoid using loops? Looping in a functional programming language involves using higher-order functions and lists. A reminder: a higher-order function is a function that takes another function as an argument. Looping is a task like any other, so I can write a function that does the looping. This function, which I’ll call looping(), will take a function as an argument, as well as a list. The list will serve as the container to hold our numbers:\n\nlooping &lt;- function(a_list, a_func, init = NULL, ...){\n\n  # If the user does not provide an `init` value,\n  # set the head of the list as the initial value\n  if(is.null(init)){\n    init &lt;- a_list[[1]]\n    a_list &lt;- tail(a_list, -1)\n  }\n\n  # Separate the head from the tail of the list\n  # and apply the function to the initial value and the head of the list\n  head_list = a_list[[1]]\n  tail_list = tail(a_list, -1)\n  init = a_func(init, head_list, ...)\n\n  # Check if we're done: if there is still some tail,\n  # rerun the whole thing until there's no tail left\n  if(length(tail_list) != 0){\n    looping(tail_list, a_func, init, ...)\n  }\n  else {\n    init\n  }\n}\n\nNow, this might seem much more complicated than a for loop. However, now that we have abstracted the loop away inside a function, we can keep reusing this function:\n\nlooping(as.list(seq(1, 100)), `+`)\n\n[1] 5050\n\n\nOf course, because this is so useful, looping() actually ships with R, and is called Reduce():\n\nReduce(`+`, seq(1, 100)) # the order of the arguments is `function` then `list` for `Reduce()`\n\n[1] 5050\n\n\nBut this is not the only way that we can loop. We can also write a loop that applies a function to each element of a list, instead of operating on the whole list:\n\nresult &lt;- as.list(seq(1, 5))\nfor (i in seq_along(result)){\n  result[[i]] &lt;- sqrt(result[[i]])\n}\n\nprint(result)\n\n[[1]]\n[1] 1\n\n[[2]]\n[1] 1.414214\n\n[[3]]\n[1] 1.732051\n\n[[4]]\n[1] 2\n\n[[5]]\n[1] 2.236068\n\n\nHere again, we have to pollute the global environment by first creating a vessel for our results, and then apply the function at each index. We can abstract this process away in a function:\n\napplying &lt;- function(a_list, a_func, ...){\n\n  head_list = a_list[[1]]\n  tail_list = tail(a_list, -1)\n  result = a_func(head_list, ...)\n\n  # Check if we're done: if there is still some tail, rerun the whole thing until there's no tail left\n  if(length(tail_list) != 0){\n    append(result, applying(tail_list, a_func, ...))\n  }\n  else {\n    result\n  }\n}\n\nOnce again this might seem complicated, and I would agree. Abstraction is complex. But once we have it, we can focus on the task at hand, instead of having to always tell the computer what we want:\n\napplying(as.list(seq(1, 5)), sqrt)\n\n[1] 1.000000 1.414214 1.732051 2.000000 2.236068\n\n\nOf course, R ships with its own, much more efficient, implementation of this function:\n\nlapply(list(seq(1, 5)), sqrt)\n\n[[1]]\n[1] 1.000000 1.414214 1.732051 2.000000 2.236068\n\n\nIn other programming languages, lapply() is often called map(). The {purrr} package ships with other such useful higher-order functions that abstract loops away. For example, there’s the function called map2(), that maps a function of two arguments to each element of two atomic vectors or lists, two at a time:\n\nlibrary(purrr)\n\nmap2(\n  .x = seq(1, 5),\n  .y = seq(1, 5),\n  .f = `+`\n  )\n\n[[1]]\n[1] 2\n\n[[2]]\n[1] 4\n\n[[3]]\n[1] 6\n\n[[4]]\n[1] 8\n\n[[5]]\n[1] 10\n\n\nIf you have more than two lists, you can use pmap() instead.\nAnother important, idiomatic, way to deal with loops in R is to use matrix algebra instead. For example, to compute the sum of the first 100 integers, the following approach is possible:\n\nrep(1, 100) %*% seq(1, 100)\n\n     [,1]\n[1,] 5050\n\n\nAlso, don’t forget that many functions are vectorized by default, so no loop is required:\n\nsqrt(seq(1, 5))\n\n[1] 1.000000 1.414214 1.732051 2.000000 2.236068\n\n\nor:\n\nseq(1, 5) + seq(1, 5)\n\n[1]  2  4  6  8 10\n\n\nBefore diving directly into loops, check if the functions you’re using are vectorized, or if there is a simple way to express the computation you want to run in terms of matrix multiplication.\n\n\n6.3.4 Data frames\nAs mentioned in the introduction of this section, data frames are a special type of list of atomic vectors. This means that just as I can use lapply() to compute the square root of the elements of an atomic vector, as shown previously, I can also operate on all the columns of a data frame. For example, it is possible to determine the class of every column of a data frame like this:\n\nlapply(iris, class)\n\n$Sepal.Length\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n$Sepal.Width\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n$Petal.Length\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n$Petal.Width\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n$Species\n[1] \"factor\"\n\n\nUnlike a list however, the elements of a data frame must be of the same length. Data frames remain very flexible though, and using what we have learned until now it is possible to use the data frame as a structure for all our computations. For example, suppose that we have a data frame that contains data on unemployment for the different subnational divisions of the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg, the country the author of this book hails from. Let’s suppose that I want to generate several plots, per subnational division and per year. Typically, we would use a loop for this, but we can use what we’ve learned here, as well as some functions from the {dplyr}, {purrr}, {ggplot2} and {tidyr} packages. I will be downloading data that I made available inside a package, but instead of installing the package, I will download the .rda file directly (which is the file format of packaged data) and then load that data into our R session:\n\n# Create a temporary file\nunemp_path &lt;- tempfile(fileext = \".rda\")\n\n# Download the data and save it to the path of the temporary file\n# avoids having to install the package from Github\ndownload.file(\"https://github.com/b-rodrigues/myPackage/raw/main/data/unemp.rda\",\n              destfile = unemp_path)\n\n# Load the data. The data is now available as 'unemp'\nload(unemp_path)\n\nLet’s load the required packages and take a look at the data:\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(purrr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\nglimpse(unemp)\n\nRows: 472\nColumns: 9\n$ year                         &lt;dbl&gt; 2013, 2013, 2013, 2013, 2013, 2013, 2013,…\n$ place_name                   &lt;chr&gt; \"Luxembourg\", \"Capellen\", \"Dippach\", \"Gar…\n$ level                        &lt;chr&gt; \"Country\", \"Canton\", \"Commune\", \"Commune\"…\n$ total_employed_population    &lt;dbl&gt; 223407, 17802, 1703, 844, 1431, 4094, 214…\n$ of_which_wage_earners        &lt;dbl&gt; 203535, 15993, 1535, 750, 1315, 3800, 187…\n$ of_which_non_wage_earners    &lt;dbl&gt; 19872, 1809, 168, 94, 116, 294, 272, 113,…\n$ unemployed                   &lt;dbl&gt; 19287, 1071, 114, 25, 74, 261, 98, 45, 66…\n$ active_population            &lt;dbl&gt; 242694, 18873, 1817, 869, 1505, 4355, 224…\n$ unemployment_rate_in_percent &lt;dbl&gt; 7.947044, 5.674773, 6.274078, 2.876870, 4…\n\n\nColumn names are self-descriptive, but the level column needs some explanations. level contains the administrative divisions of the country, so the country of Luxembourg, then the Cantons and then the Communes.\nRemember that Luxembourg can refer to the country, the canton or the commune of Luxembourg. Now let’s suppose that I want a separate plot for the three communes of Luxembourg, Esch-sur-Alzette and Wiltz. Instead of creating three separate data frames and feeding them to the same ggplot code, I can instead take advantage of the fact that data frames are lists, and are thus quite flexible. Let’s start with filtering:\n\nfiltered_unemp &lt;- unemp %&gt;%\n  filter(\n    level == \"Commune\",\n    place_name %in% c(\"Luxembourg\", \"Esch-sur-Alzette\", \"Wiltz\")\n   )\n\nglimpse(filtered_unemp)\n\nRows: 12\nColumns: 9\n$ year                         &lt;dbl&gt; 2013, 2013, 2013, 2014, 2014, 2014, 2015,…\n$ place_name                   &lt;chr&gt; \"Esch-sur-Alzette\", \"Luxembourg\", \"Wiltz\"…\n$ level                        &lt;chr&gt; \"Commune\", \"Commune\", \"Commune\", \"Commune…\n$ total_employed_population    &lt;dbl&gt; 12725, 39513, 2344, 13155, 40768, 2377, 1…\n$ of_which_wage_earners        &lt;dbl&gt; 12031, 35531, 2149, 12452, 36661, 2192, 1…\n$ of_which_non_wage_earners    &lt;dbl&gt; 694, 3982, 195, 703, 4107, 185, 710, 4140…\n$ unemployed                   &lt;dbl&gt; 2054, 3855, 318, 1997, 3836, 315, 2031, 3…\n$ active_population            &lt;dbl&gt; 14779, 43368, 2662, 15152, 44604, 2692, 1…\n$ unemployment_rate_in_percent &lt;dbl&gt; 13.898099, 8.889043, 11.945905, 13.179778…\n\n\nWe are now going to use the fact that data frames are lists, and that lists can hold any type of object. For example, remember this list from before where one of the elements is a data frame, and the second one a formula:\n\nlist(\n  \"a\" = head(mtcars),\n  \"b\" = ~lm(y ~ x)\n  )\n\n$a\n                   mpg cyl disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb\nMazda RX4         21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.620 16.46  0  1    4    4\nMazda RX4 Wag     21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.875 17.02  0  1    4    4\nDatsun 710        22.8   4  108  93 3.85 2.320 18.61  1  1    4    1\nHornet 4 Drive    21.4   6  258 110 3.08 3.215 19.44  1  0    3    1\nHornet Sportabout 18.7   8  360 175 3.15 3.440 17.02  0  0    3    2\nValiant           18.1   6  225 105 2.76 3.460 20.22  1  0    3    1\n\n$b\n~lm(y ~ x)\n\n\n{dplyr} comes with a function called group_nest() which groups the data frame by a variable (such that the next computations will be performed group-wise) and then nests the other columns into a smaller data frame. Let’s try it and see what happens:\n\nnested_unemp &lt;- filtered_unemp %&gt;%\n  group_nest(place_name)\n\nLet’s see what this looks like:\n\nnested_unemp\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n  place_name                     data\n  &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;list&lt;tibble[,8]&gt;&gt;\n1 Esch-sur-Alzette            [4 × 8]\n2 Luxembourg                  [4 × 8]\n3 Wiltz                       [4 × 8]\n\n\nnested_unemp is a new data frame of 3 rows, one per commune (“Esch-sur-Alzette”, “Luxembourg”, “Wiltz”), and of two columns, one for the names of the communes, and the other contains every other variable inside a smaller data frame. So this is a data frame that has one column where each element of that column is itself a data frame. Such a column is called a list-column. This is essentially a list of lists.\nLet’s now think about this for a moment. If the column titled data is a list of data frames, it should be possible to use a function like map() or lapply() to apply a function on each of these data frames. Remember that map() or lapply() require a list of elements of whatever type and a function that accepts objects of this type as input. So this means that we could apply a function that plots the data to each element of the column titled data. Since each element of this column is a data frame, this function needs a data frame as an input. As a first and simple example to illustrate this, let’s suppose that we want to determine the number of rows of each data frame. This is how we would do it:\n\nnested_unemp %&gt;%\n  mutate(nrows = map(data, nrow)) # ’data’ is the name of\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  place_name                     data nrows    \n  &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;list&lt;tibble[,8]&gt;&gt; &lt;list&gt;   \n1 Esch-sur-Alzette            [4 × 8] &lt;int [1]&gt;\n2 Luxembourg                  [4 × 8] &lt;int [1]&gt;\n3 Wiltz                       [4 × 8] &lt;int [1]&gt;\n\n                                  # the list-column that contains\n                                  # the smaller data frames\n\nThe new column, titled nrows is a list of integers. We can simplify it by converting it directly to an atomic vector of integers by using map_int() instead of map():\n\nnested_unemp %&gt;%\n  mutate(nrows = map_int(data, nrow))\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  place_name                     data nrows\n  &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;list&lt;tibble[,8]&gt;&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n1 Esch-sur-Alzette            [4 × 8]     4\n2 Luxembourg                  [4 × 8]     4\n3 Wiltz                       [4 × 8]     4\n\n\nLet’s try a more complex example now. What if we want to filter rows (of course, the simplest way would be to filter the rows we need before nesting the data frame)? We need to apply the function filter() where its first argument is a data frame and the second argument is a predicate:\n\nnested_unemp %&gt;%\n  mutate(nrows = map(data, \\(x)filter(x, year == 2015)))\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  place_name                     data nrows           \n  &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;list&lt;tibble[,8]&gt;&gt; &lt;list&gt;          \n1 Esch-sur-Alzette            [4 × 8] &lt;tibble [1 × 8]&gt;\n2 Luxembourg                  [4 × 8] &lt;tibble [1 × 8]&gt;\n3 Wiltz                       [4 × 8] &lt;tibble [1 × 8]&gt;\n\n\nIn this case, we need to use an anonymous function. This is because filter() has two arguments and we need to make clear what it is we are mapping over and what argument stays fixed; we are mapping over (iterating) the data frames but the predicate year == 2015 stays fixed.\nWe are now ready to plot our data. The best way to continue is to first get the function right by creating one plot for one single commune. Let’s select the dataset for the commune of Luxembourg:\n\nlux_data &lt;- nested_unemp %&gt;%\n  filter(place_name == \"Luxembourg\") %&gt;%\n  unnest(data)\n\nTo plot this data, we can now write the required ggplot2() code:\n\nggplot(data = lux_data) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  geom_line(\n    aes(year, unemployment_rate_in_percent, group = 1)\n   ) +\n  labs(title = \"Unemployment in Luxembourg\")\n\n\n\n\nTo turn the lines of code above into a function, you need to think about how many arguments that function would have. There is an obvious one, the data itself (in the snippet above, the data is the lux_data object). Another one that is less obvious is in the title:\nlabs(title = \"Unemployment in Luxembourg\")\nIdeally, we would want that title to change depending on the data set. So we could write the function like so:\n\nmake_plot &lt;- function(x, y){\n  ggplot(data = x) +\n    theme_minimal() +\n    geom_line(\n      aes(year, unemployment_rate_in_percent, group = 1)\n      ) +\n    labs(title = paste(\"Unemployment in\", y))\n}\n\nLet’s try it on our data:\n\nmake_plot(lux_data, \"Luxembourg\")\n\n\n\n\nOk, so now, we simply need to apply this function to our nested data frame:\n\nnested_unemp &lt;- nested_unemp %&gt;%\n  mutate(plots = map2(\n    .x = data, # column of data frames\n    .y = place_name, # column of commune names\n    .f = make_plot\n  ))\n\nnested_unemp\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  place_name                     data plots \n  &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;list&lt;tibble[,8]&gt;&gt; &lt;list&gt;\n1 Esch-sur-Alzette            [4 × 8] &lt;gg&gt;  \n2 Luxembourg                  [4 × 8] &lt;gg&gt;  \n3 Wiltz                       [4 × 8] &lt;gg&gt;  \n\n\nIf you look at the plots column, you see that it is a list of gg objects: these are our plots. Let’s take a look at them:\n\nnested_unemp$plots\n\n[[1]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[2]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[3]]\n\n\n\n\n\nWe could also have used an anonymous function (but it is more difficult to get right):\n\nnested_unemp %&gt;%\n  mutate(plots2 = map2(\n    .x = data,\n    .y = place_name,\n    .f = \\(.x,.y)(\n                ggplot(data = .x) +\n                  theme_minimal() +\n                  geom_line(\n                    aes(year, unemployment_rate_in_percent, group = 1)\n                   ) +\n                  labs(title = paste(\"Unemployment in\", .y))\n                  )\n           )\n         ) %&gt;%\n  pull(plots2)\n\n[[1]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[2]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[3]]\n\n\n\n\n\nThis list-column based workflow is extremely powerful and I highly advise you to take the required time to master it. Remember, we never want to have to repeat ourselves. This approach might seem more complicated than calling make_plot() three times, but imagine that you need to do this for several countries, several variables, etc… What are you going to do, copy and paste code everywhere? This gets very tedious and more importantly, very error-prone, because now you’ve just introduced many points of failure by having so much copy-pasted code. You could of course use a loop instead of this list-column based workflow. But as mentioned, the issue with loops is that you have to interact with the global environment, which can lead to other issues. But whatever you end up using, you need to avoid copy and pasting at all costs."

    "section": "6.4 Functional programming in R",
    "text": "6.4 Functional programming in R\nUp until now I focused on general concepts rather than on specifics of the R programming language when it comes to functional programming. In this section, we will be focusing entirely on R-specific capabilities and packages for functional programming.\n\n6.4.1 Base capabilities\nR is a functional programming language (but not only), and as such it comes with many functions out of the box to write functional code. We have already discussed lapply() and Reduce(). You should know that depending on what you want to achieve, there are other functions that are similar to lapply(): apply(), sapply(), vapply(), mapply() and tapply(). There’s also Map() which is a wrapper around mapply(). Each function performs the same basic task of applying a function over all the elements of a list or list-like structure, but it can be hard to keep them apart and when you should use one over another. This is why {purrr}, which we will discuss in the next section, is quite an interesting alternative to base R’s offering.\nAnother one of the quintessential functional programming functions (alongside Reduce() and Map()) that ships with R is Filter(). If you know dplyr::filter() you should be familiar with the concept of filtering rows of a data frame where the elements of one particular column satisfy a predicate. Filter() works the same way, but focusing on lists instead of data frame:\n\nFilter(is.character,\n       list(\n         seq(1, 5),\n         \"Hey\")\n       )\n\n[[1]]\n[1] \"Hey\"\n\n\nThe call above only returns the elements where is.character() evaluates to TRUE.\nAnother useful function is Negate() which is a function factory that takes a boolean function as an input and returns the opposite boolean function. As an illustration, suppose that in the example above we wanted to get everything but the character:\n\nFilter(Negate(is.character),\n       list(\n         seq(1, 5),\n         \"Hey\")\n       )\n\n[[1]]\n[1] 1 2 3 4 5\n\n\nThere are some other functions like this that you might want to check out: type ?Negate in console to read more about them.\nSometimes you may need to run code with side-effects, but want to avoid any interaction between these side-effects and the global environment. For example, you might want to run some code that creates a plot and saves it to disk, or code that creates some data and writes them to disk. local() can be used for this. local() runs code in a temporary environment that gets discarded at the end:\n\nlocal({\n  a &lt;- 2\n})\n\nVariable a was created inside this local environment. Checking if it exists now yields FALSE:\n\nexists(\"a\")\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\nWe will be using this technique later in the book to keep our scripts pure.\nBefore continuing with R packages that extend R’s functional programming capabilities it’s also important to stress that just as R is a functional programming language, it is also an object oriented language. In fact, R is what John Chambers called a functional OOP language (Chambers (2014)). I won’t delve too much into what this means (read Wickham (2019) for this), but as a short discussion, consider the print() function. Depending on what type of object the user gives it, it seems as if somehow print() knows what to do with it:\n\nprint(5)\n\n[1] 5\n\nprint(head(mtcars))\n\n                   mpg cyl disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb\nMazda RX4         21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.620 16.46  0  1    4    4\nMazda RX4 Wag     21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.875 17.02  0  1    4    4\nDatsun 710        22.8   4  108  93 3.85 2.320 18.61  1  1    4    1\nHornet 4 Drive    21.4   6  258 110 3.08 3.215 19.44  1  0    3    1\nHornet Sportabout 18.7   8  360 175 3.15 3.440 17.02  0  0    3    2\nValiant           18.1   6  225 105 2.76 3.460 20.22  1  0    3    1\n\nprint(str(mtcars))\n\n'data.frame':   32 obs. of  11 variables:\n $ mpg : num  21 21 22.8 21.4 18.7 18.1 14.3 24.4 22.8 19.2 ...\n $ cyl : num  6 6 4 6 8 6 8 4 4 6 ...\n $ disp: num  160 160 108 258 360 ...\n $ hp  : num  110 110 93 110 175 105 245 62 95 123 ...\n $ drat: num  3.9 3.9 3.85 3.08 3.15 2.76 3.21 3.69 3.92 3.92 ...\n $ wt  : num  2.62 2.88 2.32 3.21 3.44 ...\n $ qsec: num  16.5 17 18.6 19.4 17 ...\n $ vs  : num  0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 ...\n $ am  : num  1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...\n $ gear: num  4 4 4 3 3 3 3 4 4 4 ...\n $ carb: num  4 4 1 1 2 1 4 2 2 4 ...\nNULL\n\n\nThis works by essentially mixing both functional and object-oriented programming, hence functional OOP. Let’s take a closer look at the source code of print() by simply typing print without brackets, into a console:\n\nprint\n\nfunction (x, ...) \nUseMethod(\"print\")\n&lt;bytecode: 0x5639e1fcaa48&gt;\n&lt;environment: namespace:base&gt;\n\n\nQuite unexpectedly, the source code of print() is one line long and is just UseMethod(\"print\"). So all print() does is use a generic method called “print”. If your text editor has auto-completion enabled, you might see that there are actually many print() functions. For example, type print.data.frame into a console:\n\nprint.data.frame\n\nfunction (x, ..., digits = NULL, quote = FALSE, right = TRUE, \n    row.names = TRUE, max = NULL) \n{\n    n &lt;- length(row.names(x))\n    if (length(x) == 0L) {\n        cat(sprintf(ngettext(n, \"data frame with 0 columns and %d row\", \n            \"data frame with 0 columns and %d rows\"), n), \"\\n\", \n            sep = \"\")\n    }\n    else if (n == 0L) {\n        print.default(names(x), quote = FALSE)\n        cat(gettext(\"&lt;0 rows&gt; (or 0-length row.names)\\n\"))\n    }\n    else {\n        if (is.null(max)) \n            max &lt;- getOption(\"max.print\", 99999L)\n        if (!is.finite(max)) \n            stop(\"invalid 'max' / getOption(\\\"max.print\\\"): \", \n                max)\n        omit &lt;- (n0 &lt;- max%/%length(x)) &lt; n\n        m &lt;- as.matrix(format.data.frame(if (omit) \n            x[seq_len(n0), , drop = FALSE]\n        else x, digits = digits, na.encode = FALSE))\n        if (!isTRUE(row.names)) \n            dimnames(m)[[1L]] &lt;- if (isFALSE(row.names)) \n                rep.int(\"\", if (omit) \n                  n0\n                else n)\n            else row.names\n        print(m, ..., quote = quote, right = right, max = max)\n        if (omit) \n            cat(\" [ reached 'max' / getOption(\\\"max.print\\\") -- omitted\", \n                n - n0, \"rows ]\\n\")\n    }\n    invisible(x)\n}\n&lt;bytecode: 0x5639e3220838&gt;\n&lt;environment: namespace:base&gt;\n\n\nThis is the print function for data.frame objects. So what print() does, is look at the class of its argument x, and then look for the right print function to call. In more traditional OOP languages, users would type something like:\n\nmtcars.print()\n\nIn these languages, objects encapsulate methods (the equivalent of our functions), so if mtcars is a data frame, it encapsulates a print() method that then does the printing. R is different, because classes and methods are kept separate. If a package developer creates a new object class, then the developer also must implement the required methods. For example in the {chronicler} package, the chronicler class is defined alongside the print.chronicler() function to print these objects.\nAll of this to say that if you want to extend R by writing packages, learning some OOP essentials is also important. But for data analysis, functional programming does the job perfectly well. To learn more about R’s different OOP systems (yes, R can do OOP in different ways and the one I sketched here is the simplest, but probably the most used as well), take a look at Wickham (2019).\n\n\n6.4.2 purrr\nThe {purrr} package, developed by Posit (formerly RStudio), contains many functions to make functional programming with R more smooth. In the previous section, we discussed the apply() family of function; they all do a very similar thing, which is looping over a list and applying a function to the elements of the list, but it is not quite easy to remember which one does what. Also, for some of these functions like apply(), the list argument comes first, and then the function, but in the case of mapply(), the function comes first. This type of inconsistencies can be frustrating. Another issue with these functions is that it is not always easy to know what type the output is going to be. List? Atomic vector? Something else?\n{purrr} solves this issue by offering the map() family of functions, which behave in a very consistent way. The basic function is called map() and we’ve already used it:\n\nmap(seq(1, 5), sqrt)\n\n[[1]]\n[1] 1\n\n[[2]]\n[1] 1.414214\n\n[[3]]\n[1] 1.732051\n\n[[4]]\n[1] 2\n\n[[5]]\n[1] 2.236068\n\n\nBut there are many interesting variants:\n\nmap_dbl(seq(1, 5), sqrt)\n\n[1] 1.000000 1.414214 1.732051 2.000000 2.236068\n\n\nmap_dbl() coerces the output to an atomic vector of doubles instead of a list of doubles. Then there’s:\n\nmap_chr(letters, toupper)\n\n [1] \"A\" \"B\" \"C\" \"D\" \"E\" \"F\" \"G\" \"H\" \"I\" \"J\" \"K\" \"L\" \"M\" \"N\" \"O\" \"P\" \"Q\" \"R\" \"S\"\n[20] \"T\" \"U\" \"V\" \"W\" \"X\" \"Y\" \"Z\"\n\n\nfor when the output needs to be an atomic vector of characters.\nThere are many others, so take a look at the documentation with ?map. There’s also walk() which is used if you’re only interested in the side-effect of the function (for example if the function takes paths as input and saves something to disk).\n{purrr} also has functions to replace Reduce(), simply called reduce() and accumulate(), and there are many, many other useful functions. Read through the documentation of the package2 and take the time to learn about all it has to offer.\n\n\n6.4.3 withr\n{withr} is a powerful package that makes it easy to “purify” functions that behave in a way that can cause problems. Remember the function from the introduction that randomly gave out a dish Bruno liked? Here it is again:\n\nh &lt;- function(name, food_list = list()){\n\n  food &lt;- sample(c(\"lasagna\", \"cassoulet\", \"feijoada\"), 1)\n\n  food_list &lt;- append(food_list, food)\n\n  print(paste0(name, \" likes \", food))\n\n  food_list\n}\n\nFor the same input, this function may return different outputs so this function is not referentially transparent. So we improved the function by adding calls to set.seed() like this:\n\nh2 &lt;- function(name, food_list = list(), seed = 123){\n\n  # We set the seed, making sure that we get the same selection of food for a given seed\n  set.seed(seed)\n  food &lt;- sample(c(\"lasagna\", \"cassoulet\", \"feijoada\"), 1)\n\n  # We now need to unset the seed, because if we don't, guess what, the seed will stay set for the whole session!\n  set.seed(NULL)\n\n  food_list &lt;- append(food_list, food)\n\n  print(paste0(name, \" likes \", food))\n\n  food_list\n}\n\nThe problem with this approach is that we need to modify our function. We can instead use withr::with_seed() to achieve the same effect:\n\nwithr::with_seed(seed = 123,\n                 h(\"Bruno\"))\n\n[1] \"Bruno likes feijoada\"\n\n\n[[1]]\n[1] \"feijoada\"\n\n\nIt is also easier to create a wrapper if needed:\n\nh3 &lt;- function(..., seed){\n  withr::with_seed(seed = seed,\n                   h(...))\n}\n\n\nh3(\"Bruno\", seed = 123)\n\n[1] \"Bruno likes feijoada\"\n\n\n[[1]]\n[1] \"feijoada\"\n\n\nIn a previous example we downloaded a dataset and loaded it into memory; we did so by first creating a temporary file, then downloading it and then loading it. Suppose that instead of loading this data into our session, we simply wanted to test whether the link was still working. We wouldn’t want to keep the loaded data in our session, so to avoid having to delete it again manually, we could use with_tempfile():\n\nwithr::with_tempfile(\"unemp\", {\n  download.file(\"https://github.com/b-rodrigues/myPackage/raw/main/data/unemp.rda\",\n                destfile = unemp)\n  load(unemp)\n  nrow(unemp)\n  }\n)\n\n[1] 472\n\n\nThe data got downloaded, and then loaded, and then we computed the number of rows of the data, without touching the global environment, or state, of our current session.\nJust like for {purrr}, {withr} has many useful functions which I encourage you to familiarize yourself with."

Writing pure functions is in my opinion not very difficult to do and comes with many benefits.

While this chapter stresses the advantages of functional programming, you should not forget that R is not a pure, and solely, functional programming language and that other paradigms, like object-oriented programming, are also available to you.

    "section": "7.1 A quick history of literate programming",
    "text": "7.1 A quick history of literate programming\nIn literate programming, authors mix code and prose, which makes the output of their programs not just a series of tables, or graphs or predictions, but a complete report that contains the results of the analysis directly embedded into it. Scripts written using literate programming are also very easy to compile, or render, into a variety of document formats like html, docx, pdf or even pptx. R supports several frameworks for literate programming: Sweave, knitr and Quarto.\nSweave was the first tool available to R (and S) users, and allowed the mixing of R and LaTeX code to create a document. Friedrich Leisch developed Sweave in 2002 and described it in his 2002 paper (Leisch (2002)). As Leisch argues, the traditional way of writing a report as part of a statistical data analysis project uses two separate steps: running the analysis using some software, and then copy and pasting the results into a word processing tool (as illustrated above). To really drive that point home: the problem with this approach is that much time is wasted copy and pasting things, so experimenting with different layouts or data analysis techniques is very time consuming. Copy and paste mistakes will also happen (it’s not a question of if, but when) and updating reports (for example, when new data comes in) means that someone will have, again, to copy and paste the updated results into a new document.\nSweave makes it possible to embed the analysis in the final document itself, by providing a way to mix LaTeX and R code which gets executed whenever the final, output document gets compiled. This gives practiotioners considerable time savings because it eliminates the copy and pasting of results from R outputs into a document.\nThe snippet below shows the example from Leisch’s paper:\n\\documentclass[a4paper]{article}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\nIn this example we embed parts of the examples from the\n\\texttt{kruskal.test} help page into a LaTeX document:\n\n&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;=\ndata (airquality)\nkruskal.test(Ozone ~ Month, data = airquality)\n@\n\nwhich shows that the location parameter of the Ozone\ndistribution varies significantly from month to month.\nFinally we include a boxplot of the data:\n\n\\begin{center}\n&lt;&lt;fig=TRUE,echo=FALSE&gt;&gt;=\nboxplot(Ozone ~ Month, data = airquality)\n@\n\\end{center}\n\n\\end{document}\nEven if you’ve never seen a LaTeX source file, you should be able to figure out what’s going on. The first line states what type of document we’re writing. Then comes \\begin{document} which tells the compiler where the document starts. Then comes the content. You can see that it’s a mixture of plain English with R code defined inside chunks starting with &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;= and ending with @. Finally, the documents ends with \\end{document}. Getting a human readable PDF from this source is a two-step process: first this source gets converted into a .tex file and then this .tex file into a PDF. Sweave is included with every R installation since version 1.5.0, and still works to this day. For example, we can test that our Sweave installation works just fine by compiling the example above. This is what the final output looks like:\n\n\n\nMore than 20 years later, the output is still the same.\n\n\nLet me just state that the fact that it is still possible to compile this example more than 20 years later is an incredible testament to how mature and stable this software is (both R, Sweave, and LaTeX). But as impressive as this is, LaTeX has a steep learning curve, and Leisch even advocated the use of the Emacs text editor to edit Sweave files, which also has a very steep learning curve (but this is entirely optional; for example I’ve edited and compiled the example on the RStudio IDE).\nThe next generation of literate programming tools was provided by a package called {knitr} in 2012. From the perspective of the user, the biggest change from Sweave is that {knitr} is able to use many different formats as source files. The one that became very likely the most widely used format is a flavour of the Markdown markup language, R Markdown (Rmd). But this is not the only difference with Sweave:{knitr} can also run code chunks for other languages, such as Python, Perl, Awk, Haskell, bash and more (Xie (2014)). Since version 1.18, {knitr} uses the {reticulate} package to provide a Python engine for the Rmd format. To illustrate the Rmd format, let’s rewrite the example from Leisch’s Sweave paper into it:\n---\noutput: pdf_document\n---\n\nIn this example we embed parts of the examples from the\n\\texttt{kruskal.test} help page into a LaTeX document:\n\n```{r}\ndata (airquality)\nkruskal.test(Ozone ~ Month, data = airquality)\n```\n\n\nwhich shows that the location parameter of the Ozone\ndistribution varies significantly from month to month.\nFinally we include a boxplot of the data:\n\n```{r, echo = FALSE}\nboxplot(Ozone ~ Month, data = airquality)\n```\nThis is what the output looks like:\n\n\n\nIt’s very close to the Sweave output.\n\n\nJust like in a Sweave document, an Rmd source file also has a header in which authors can define a number of general options. Here I’ve only specified that I wanted a pdf document as an output file. I then copy and pasted the contents from the Sweave source, but changed the chunk delimiters from &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;= and @ to ```yup to start an R chunk and ``` to end it. Remember; we need to specify the engine in the chunk because {knitr} supports many engines. For example, it is possible to run a bash command by adding this chunk to the source:\n---\noutput: pdf_document\n---\n\nIn this example we embed parts of the examples from the\n\\texttt{kruskal.test} help page into a LaTeX document:\n\n```{r}\ndata (airquality)\nkruskal.test(Ozone ~ Month, data = airquality)\n```\n\nwhich shows that the location parameter of the Ozone\ndistribution varies significantly from month to month.\nFinally we include a boxplot of the data:\n\n\n```{r, echo = FALSE}\nboxplot(Ozone ~ Month, data = airquality)\n```\n\n```{bash}\npwd\n```\n\n(bash’s pwd command shows the current working directory). You may have noticed that I’ve also keep two LaTeX commands in the source Rmd, \\texttt{} and LaTeX. This is because Rmd files get first converted into LaTeX files and then into a PDF. If you’re using RStudio, this document can be compiled by clicking a button or using a keyboard shortcut, but you can also use the rmarkdown::render() function. This function does two things transparently: it first converts the Rmd file into a source LaTeX file, and then converts it into a PDF. It is of course possible to convert the document to a Word document as well, but in this case, LaTeX commands will be ignored. Html is another widely used output format.\nIf you’re a researcher and prefer working with LaTeX directly instead of having to switch to Markdown, you can either use Sweave, or use {knitr} but instead of writing your documents using the R Markdown format, you can use the Rnw format which is basically the same as Sweave, but uses {knitr} for compilation. Take a look at this example1 from the {knitr} Github repository for example.\nYou should know that {knitr} makes it possible to author many, many different types of documents. It is possible to write books, blogs, package documentation (and even entire packages, as we shall see later in this book), Powerpoint slides… It is extremely powerful because we can use the same general R Markdown knowledge to build many different outputs.\n\n\n\nOne format to rule them all.\n\n\nFinally, the latest in literate programming for R is a new tool developed by Posit, called Quarto. If you’re an R user and already know {knitr} and the Rmd format, you should be able to immediately use Quarto. So what’s the difference? In practice and for R users not much but there are some things that Quarto is able to do out of the box for which you’d need extensions with {knitr}. Quarto has some nice defaults; in fact this book is written in Quarto’s Markdown flavour and compiled with Quarto instead of {knitr} because the default Quarto output looks nicer than the default {knitr} output. However, there may even be things that Quarto can’t do at all (at least for now) when compared to {knitr}. So why bother switching? Well, Quarto provides sane defaults and some nice features out of the box, and the cost of switching from the Rmd format to Quarto’s Qmd format is basically 0. Also, and this is probably the biggest reason to use Quarto, Quarto is not tied to R. Quarto is actually a standalone tool that needs to be installed alongside your R installation, and works completely independently. In fact, you can use Quarto without having R installed at all, as Quarto, just like {knitr} supports many engines. This means that if you’re primarily using Python, you can author documents with Quarto that executed Python chunks. Quarto also supports the Julia programming language and Observable JS, making it possible to include interactive visualisations into an Html document. Let’s take a look at how the example from Leisch’s paper looks as a Qmd (Quarto’s flavour of Markdown) file:\n---\noutput: pdf\n---\n\nIn this example we embed parts of the examples from the\n\\texttt{kruskal.test} help page into a LaTeX document:\n\n```{r}\ndata (airquality)\nkruskal.test(Ozone ~ Month, data = airquality)\n```\n\n\nwhich shows that the location parameter of the Ozone\ndistribution varies significantly from month to month.\nFinally we include a boxplot of the data:\n\n```{r, echo = FALSE}\nboxplot(Ozone ~ Month, data = airquality)\n```\n(I’ve omitted the bash chunk from before, not because Quarto does not support it, but to keep close to the original example from the paper.)\nAs you can see, it’s exactly the same as the Rmd file from before. The only difference is in the header. In the Rmd file I specified the output format as:\n\n---\noutput: pdf_document\n---\n\nwhereas in the Qmd file we changed it to:\n\n---\noutput: pdf\n---\n\nWhile Quarto is the latest option in literate programming, it is quite recent, and as such, I feel it might be better to stick with {knitr} and the Rmd format for now, so that’s what we’re going to use going forward. Also, the {knitr} and the Rmd format are here to stay, so there’s little risk in keeping using it, and anyways, as already stated, if switching to Quarto becomes a necessity, the cost of switching would be very, very low. In what follows, I won’t be focused on anything really {knitr} or Rmd specific, so should you want to use Quarto instead, you should be able to follow along without any problems at all, since the Rmd and Qmd formats have so much overlap. Also, Quarto needs to be installed separately, but to use {knitr} and RMarkdown, no specific tools are necessary.\nIn the next two sections, I will show how to set up and use {knitr} as well as give you a quick overview of the R Markdown syntax. However, we will very quickly focus on the templating capabilities of {knitr}: expanding text, using child documents, and parameterised reports. These are advanced topics and not easy to tackle if you’re not comfortable with R already. Just as functions and higher-order functions like lapply() avoid having to repeat yourself, so does templating, but for literate programming. The goal is to write functions that return literal R Markdown code, so that you can loop over these functions to build entire sections of your documents. However, the learning curve for these features is quite steep, but by now, you should have noticed that this book expects a lot from you. Keep going, and you shall be handsomely rewarded."

    "text": "7.2 {knitr} basics\nThis section will be a very small intro to {knitr}. I’m going to teach you just enough to get started writing Rmd files. Most, if not all, of what I’ll be explaining here is also applicable to the Qmd format. There are many resources out there that you can use if you want to dig deeper, for instance the R Markdown website2 from Posit, or the R Markdown: The Definitive Guide3 and R Markdown Cookbook4 eBooks. I will also not assume that you are using the RStudio IDE and give you instead the lower level commands to render documents. If you use RStudio and want to know how to use it effectively to author Rmd documents, you should take a look at this5 page. In fact, this section will basically focus on the same topics, but without RStudio.\n\n7.2.1 Set up\nThe first step is to install the {knitr} and the {rmarkdown} packages. That’s easy, just type:\n\ninstall.packages(\"rmarkdown\")\n\nin an R console. Since {knitr} is required to install {rmarkdown}, it gets installed automatically. If you want to compile PDF documents, you should also have a working LaTeX distribution. You can skip this next part if you’re only interested in generating Html and Word files. For what follows in the book, we will only be rendering Html documents, so no need to install LaTeX (by the way, you don’t even need a working Word installation to compile documents to the docx format). However, if you already have a working LaTeX installation, you shouldn’t have to do anything else to generate PDF documents. If you don’t have a working LaTeX distribution, then Yihui Xie, the creator of {knitr} created an R package called {tinytex} that makes it extremely easy to install. In fact, this is the way I recommend installing LaTeX even if you’re not an R user (it is possible to use the tinytex distribution without R; it’s just that the {tinytex} R package provides many functions that makes installing and maintaining it very easy). Simply run these commands in an R console to get started:\n\ninstall.packages(\"tinytex\")\ntinytex::install_tinytex()\n\nand that’s it! If you need to install specific LaTeX packages, then refer to the Maintenance section on tinytex’s website. For example, to compile the example from Leisch’s article on Sweave discussed previously, the grfext LaTeX package needs to be installed (as explained by the error output in the console when I tried compiling). To install this package, you can use the tlmgr_install() function from {tinytex}:\n\ntlmgr_install(\"grfext\")\n\nAfter you’ve installed {knitr}, {rmarkdown} and, optionally, {tinytex}, simply try to compile the following document:\n---\noutput: html_document\n---\n\n# Document title\n\n## Section title\n\n### Subsection title\n\nThis is **bold** text. This is *text in italics*.\n\nMy favourite programming language for statistics is ~~SAS~~ R.\nsave this document into a file called rmd_intro.rmd using your favourite text editor. Then render it into an Html file by running the following command in the R console:\n\nrmarkdown::render(\"path/to/rmd_test.rmd\")\n\nThis should create a file called rmd_test.html; open it with your web browser and you should see the following:\n\n\n\nThis is how formatting looks like, once the document is compiled.\n\n\nCongratulations, you just knitted your first Rmd document!\n\n\n7.2.2 Markdown ultrabasics\nR Markdown is a flavour of Markdown, which means that you should know some Markdown to really take full advantage of R Markdown. The example document from before should have already shown you some basics: titles, sections and subsections all start with a # and the depth level is determined by the number of #s. For bold text, simply put the words in between ** and for italics use only one *. If you want bold and italics, use ***. The original designer of Markdown did not think that underlining text was important, so there is no easy way of doing it, unfortunately. For this, you need to use a somewhat hidden feature; without going into too many technical details, the program that converts Rmd files to the final output format is called Pandoc, and it’s possible to use some of Pandoc’s features to format text. For example, for underlining:\n[This is some underlined text in a R Markdown document]{.underline}\nThis will underline the text between square brackets.6\nThe next step is to mix code and prose. As you’ve seen from Leisch’s canonical example, this is quite easily achieved by using R code chunks. The R Markdown example below shows various code chunks alongside some options. For example, a code chunk that uses the echo = FALSE option will not appear (but the output of the computation will):\n---\ntitle: \"Document title\"\noutput: html_document\ndate: \"2023-01-28\"\n---\n\n# R code chunks\n\nThis below is an R code chunk:\n\n```{r}\ndata(mtcars)\n\nplot(mtcars)\n```\n\n\nThe code chunk above will appear in the final output. \nThe code chunk below will be hidden:\n\n```{r, echo = FALSE}\ndata(iris)\n\nplot(iris)\n```\n\n\nThis next code chunk will not be evaluated:\n\n```{r, eval = FALSE}\ndata(titanic)\n\nstr(titanic)\n```\n\n\nThe last one below runs, but code and output from the code is \nnot shown in the final document. This is useful for loading \nlibraries and hiding startup messages:\n\n```{r, include = FALSE}\nlibrary(dplyr)\n```\nIf you use RStudio and create a new R Markdown file from the menu, a template R Markdown file is generated for you to fill out. The first R chunk is this one:\n```{r setup, include=FALSE}\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)\n```\nThis is an R chunk named setup and with the option include = FALSE. Naming chunks is optional, but we are going to make use of this later on. The code that runs in this chunk defines a global option to show the source code from all the chunks by default (which is the default behaviour). You can change TRUE to FALSE if you want to hide every code chunk instead (if you’re using Quarto, global options are set differently7).\nSomething else you might have noticed in the previous example, is that we’ve added some more content in the header:\n---\ntitle: \"Document title\"\noutput: html_document\ndate: \"2023-01-28\"\n---\nThere are several other options available that you can define in the header. Later on I will show you some more options, for example how to define a table of contents.\nTo finish this part on code chunks, you should know about inline code chunks. Take a look at the following example:\n---\ntitle: \"Document title\"\noutput: html_document\ndate: \"2023-01-28\"\n---\n\n# R code chunks\n\n```{r, echo = FALSE}\ndata(iris)\n```\n\n\nThe iris dataset has `r nrow(iris)` rows.\nThe last sentence from this example has an inline code chunk. This is quite useful, as it allows to parameterise sentences and paragraphs, and thus avoids needing to copy and paste (and we will go quite far into how to avoid copy and pasting, thanks to more advanced features we will shortly discuss).\nTo finish this crash course, you should know that to use footnotes you need to write the following:\nThis sentence has a footnote.[^1]\n\n[^1]: This is the footnote.\nor the following (which I prefer):\nThis sentence has a footnote.^[This is the footnote]\nand that you can write LaTeX formulas as well. For example, add the lines below into the example from before and render either a PDF or a Html document (don’t put the LaTeX formula below inside a chunk, simply paste it as if it were normal text. This doesn’t work for Word output because Word does not support LaTeX equations):\n\\begin{align*}\nS(\\omega) \n&= \\frac{\\alpha g^2}{\\omega^5} \n  e^{[ -0.74\\bigl\\{\\frac{\\omega U_\\omega 19.5}{g}\\bigr\\}\n   ^{\\!-4}\\,]} \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\alpha g^2}{\\omega^5} \n\\exp\\Bigl[ -0.74\\Bigl\\{\\frac{\\omega U_\\omega 19.5}{g}\\Bigr\\}\n  ^{\\!-4}\\,\\Bigr] \n\\end{align*}\nThe LaTeX code above results in this equation:\n\n\n\nA rendered LaTeX equation."

    "text": "7.3 Keeping it DRY\nRemember; we never, ever, want to have to repeat ourselves. Copy and pasting is forbidden. Striving for 0 copy and pasting will make our code much more robust and likely to be correct.\nTo keep DRY, we started by using functions, as discussed in the previous chapter, but we can go much farther than that. For example, suppose that we need to write a document that has the following structure:\n\nA title\nA section\nA table inside this section\nAnother section\nAnother table inside this section\nYet another section\nYet another table inside this section\n\nIs there a way to automate the creation of such a document by taking advantage of the repeating structure? Of course there is. The question is not, is it possible to do X?, but how to do X?.\n\n7.3.1 Generating R Markdown code from code\nThe example below is a fully working minimal example of this. Copy it inside a document titled something like rmd_templating.Rmd and render it. You will see that the output contains more sections than defined in the source. This is because we use templating at the end. Take some time to read the document, as the text inside explains what is going on:\n---\ntitle: \"Templating\"\noutput: html_document\ndate: \"2023-01-27\"\n---\n\n```{r setup, include=FALSE}\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)\n```\n\n\n## A function that creates tables\n\n```{r}\ncreate_table &lt;- function(dataset, var){\n  table(dataset[var]) |&gt;\n    knitr::kable()\n}\n```\n\n\nThe function above uses the `table()` function to create \nfrequency tables, and then this gets passed to the \n`knitr::kable()` function that produces a good looking table \nfor our rendered document:\n\n```{r}\ncreate_table(mtcars, \"am\")\n```\n\n\nLet’s suppose that we want to generate a document that would\nlook like this:\n\n- first a section title, with the name of the variable of interest\n- then the table\n\nSo it would look like this:\n\n## Frequency table for variable: \"am\"\n\n```{r}\ncreate_table(mtcars, \"am\")\n```\n\n\nWe don’t want to create these sections for every variable by hand.\n\nInstead, we can define a function that returns the R markdown \ncode required to create this. This is this function:\n\n```{r}\nreturn_section &lt;- function(dataset, var){\n  a &lt;- knitr::knit_expand(text = c(\n                       \"## Frequency table for variable: {{variable}}\",\n                       create_table(dataset, var)),\n                     variable = var)\n  cat(a, sep = \"\\n\")\n}\n```\n\n\nThis new function, `return_section()` uses `knitr::knit_expand()` \nto generate R Markdown code. Words between `{{}}` get replaced by \nthe provided `var` argument to the function. So when we call \n`return_section(\"am\")`, `{{variable}}` is replaced by `\"am\"`.\n`\"am\"` then gets passed down to `create_table()` and the\nfrequency table gets generated. We can now generate all the \nsection by simply applying our function to a list of column names:\n\n```{r, results = \"asis\"}\ninvisible(lapply(colnames(mtcars), return_section, dataset = mtcars))\n```\nThe last function, named return_section() uses knitr::knit_expand(), which is the function that does the heavy lifting. This function returns literal R Markdown code. It returns ## Frequency table for variable: {{variable}} which creates a level 2 section title with the text Frequency table for variable: xxx where the xxx will get replaced by the variable passed to return_section(). So calling return_section(mtcars, \"am\") will print the following in your console:\n## Frequency table for variable: am\n|am | Freq|\n|:--|----:|\n|0  |   19|\n|1  |   13|\nWe now simply need to find a clever way to apply this function to each variable in the mtcars dataset. For this, we are going to use lapply() which implements a for loop (you could use purrr::map() just as well for this):\n\ninvisible(lapply(colnames(mtcars),\n                 return_section,\n                 dataset = mtcars))\n\nThis will create, for each variable in mtcars, the same R Markdown code as above. Notice that the R Markdown chunk where the call to lapply() is has the option results = \"asis\". This is because the function returns literal Markdown code, and we don’t want the parser to have to parse it again. We tell the parser “don’t worry about this bit of code, it’s already good”. As you see, the call to lapply() is wrapped inside invisible(). This is because return_section() does not return anything, it just prints something to the console. No object is returned. return_section() is a function with only a side-effect: it changes something outside its scope. So if you don’t wrap the call to lapply() inside invisible(), then a bunch of NULLs will also get printed (NULLs get returned by functions that don’t return anything). To avoid this, use invisible() (and use purrr::walk() rather than purrr::map() if you want to use tidyverse packages and functions).\nSee the output here8.\nThis is not an easy topic, so take the time to play around with the example above. Try to print another table, try to generate more complex Markdown code, remove the call to invisible() and knit the document and see what happens with the output, replace the call to lapply() with purrr::walk() or purrr::map(). Really take the time to understand what is going on.\nWhile extremely powerful, this approach using knitr::knit_expand() only works if your template only contains text. If you need to print something more complicated in the document, you need to use child documents instead. For example, suppose that instead of a table we wanted to show a plot made using {ggplot2}. This would not work, because a ggplot object is not made of text, but is a list with many elements. The print() method for ggplot objects then does some magic and prints a plot. But if you want to show plots using knitr::knit_expand(), then the contents of the list will be shown, not the plot itself. This is where child documents come in. Child documents are exactly what you think they are: they’re smaller documents that get knitted and then embedded into the parent document. You can define anything within these child documents, and as such you can even use them to print more complex objects, like a ggplot object. Let’s go back to the example from before and make use of a child document (for ease of presentation, we will not use a separate Rmd file, but will inline the child document into the main document). Read the Rmd example below carefully, as all the steps are explained:\n---\ntitle: \"Templating with child documents\"\noutput: html_document\ndate: \"2023-01-27\"\n---\n\n```{r setup, include=FALSE}\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n```\n\n## A function that creates ggplots\n\n```{r}\ncreate_plot &lt;- function(dataset, aesthetic){\n\n  ggplot(dataset) +\n    geom_point(aesthetic)\n\n}\n```\n\nThe function above takes a dataset and an aesthetic \nmade using `ggplot2::aes()` to create a plot:\n\n```{r}\ncreate_plot(mtcars, aes(y = mpg, x = hp))\n```\n\nLet’s suppose that we want to generate a document \nthat would look like this:\n\n- first a section title, with the dataset used;\n- then a plot\n\nSo it would look like this:\n\n## Dataset used: \"mtcars\"\n\n```{r}\ncreate_plot(mtcars, aes(y = mpg, x = hp))\n```\n\nWe don’t want to create these sections for every \naesthetic by hand.\n\nInstead, we can make use of a child document that \ngets knitted separately and then embedded in the \nparent document. The chunk below makes use of this trick:\n\n```{r, results = \"asis\"}\n\nx &lt;- list(aes(y = mpg, x = hp),\n          aes(y = mpg, x = hp, size = am))\n\nres &lt;- lapply(x,\n              function(dataset, x){\n\n  knitr::knit_child(text = c(\n\n    '\\n',\n    '## Dataset used: `r deparse(substitute(dataset))`',\n    '\\n',\n    '```{r, echo = F}',\n    'print(create_plot(dataset, x))',\n    '```'\n\n     ),\n     envir = environment(),\n     quiet = TRUE)\n\n}, dataset = mtcars)\n\n\ncat(unlist(res), sep = \"\\n\")\n```\n\nThe child document is the `text` argument to the \n`knit_child()` function. `text` is literal R Markdown \ncode: we define a level 2 header, and then an R chunk. \nThis child document gets knitted, so we need to specify \nthe environment in which it should get knitted. This means\nthat the child document will get knitted in the same \nenvironment as the parent document (our current global\nenvironment). This way, every package that gets loaded \nand every function or variable that got defined in the \nparent document will also be available to the child document.\n\nTo get the dataset name as a string, we use the \n`deparse(substitute(dataset))` trick; this substitutes \n\"dataset\" by its bound value, so `mtcars`. But `mtcars` is \nan expression and we don’t want it to get evaluated, or the \ncontents of the entire dataset would be used in the title \nof the section. So we use `deparse()` which turns unevaluated \nexpressions into strings.\n\nWe then use `lapply()` to loop over two aesthetics with an \nanonymous function that encapsulates the child document. So we \nget two child documents that get knitted, one per aesthetic. \nThis gets saved into variable `res`. This is thus a list of \nknitted Markdown.\n\nFinally, we need unlist `res` to actually merge the Markdown \ncode from the child documents into the parent document.\nSee the output here9.\nHere again, take some time to play with the above example. Change the child document, try to print other types of output, really take your time to understand this. To know more about child documents, take a look at this section10 of the R Markdown Cookbook (Xie, Dervieux, and Riederer (2020)).\n\n\n7.3.2 Tables in R Markdown documents\nGetting tables right in Rmd documents is not always an easy task. There are several packages specifically made just for this task, and the package that I recommend tick the following two important boxes:\n\nWork the same way regardless of output format (Word, PDF or Html);\nWork for any type of table: summary tables, regression tables, two-way tables, etc.\n\nLet’s start with the simplest type of table, which would is a table that simply shows some rows of data. {knitr} comes with the kable() function, but this function generates a very plain looking output. For something publication-worthy, we recommend the {flextable} package, developed by Gohel and Skintzos (2023):\n\nlibrary(flextable)\n\nmy_table &lt;- head(mtcars)\n\nflextable(my_table) |&gt;\n  set_caption(caption = \"Head of the mtcars dataset\") |&gt;\n  theme_booktabs()\n\n\n\n\nThe output of the code above.\n\n\nNote that the example above will work pretty much the same way for any table that you can coerce into a data frame! We won’t go into much detail on how {flextable} works, but it is very powerful, and the fact that it works for PDF, Html, Word and Powerpoint outputs is really a massive plus. If you want to learn more about {flextable}, there’s a whole, free, ebook on it11. {flextable} can create very complicated tables, so really take the time to dig in!\nThe next package is {modelsummary}, by Arel-Bundock (2022), and this one focuses on regression and summary tables. It is extremely powerful as well, and just like {flextable}, works for any type of output. It is very simple to get started:\n\nlibrary(modelsummary)\n\nmodel_1 &lt;- lm(mpg ~ hp + am, data = mtcars)\nmodel_2 &lt;- lm(mpg ~ hp, data = mtcars)\n\nmodels &lt;- list(\"Model 1\" = model_1,\n               \"Model 2\" = model_2)\n\nmodelsummary(models)\n\n\n\n\nEstimated models are shown side by side.\n\n\nHere again, I won’t got into much detail, but recommend instead that you read the package’s website12 which has very detailed documentation.\nThese packages can help you keeping it DRY, so take some time to learn them.\nAnd one last thing: if you’re a researcher, take a look at the {rticles}13 package, which provides Rmd templates to write articles for many scientific journals.\n\n\n7.3.3 Parametrized reports\nTemplating and child documents are very powerful, but sometimes you don’t want to have one section dedicated to each unit of analysis within the same report, but rather, you want a complete separate report by unit of analysis. This is possible thanks to parameterised reports.\nLet’s change the example from before, which consisted of creating one section per column of the mtcars dataset and a frequency table, and make it now one separate report for each column. The R Markdown file will look like this:\n---\ntitle: \"Report for column `r params$var` of dataset `r params$dataset`\"\noutput: html_document\ndate: \"2023-01-27\"\nparams:\n  dataset: mtcars\n  var: \"am\"\n---\n\n```{r setup, include=FALSE}\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)\n```\n\n\n## Frequency table for `r params$var`\n\n```{r, echo = F}\ncreate_table &lt;- function(dataset, var){\n\n  dataset &lt;- get(dataset)\n\n  table(dataset[var]) |&gt;\n    knitr::kable()\n}\n```\n\n\nThe table below is for variable `r params$var` of \ndataset `r params$dataset`.\n\n```{r}\ncreate_table(params$dataset, params$var)\n```\n\n```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}\n# Run these lines to compile the document\n# Set eval and echo to FALSE, so that this does not appear\n# in the output, and does not get evaluated when knitting\nrmarkdown::render(\n             input = \"param_report_example.Rmd\",\n             params = list(\n               dataset = \"mtcars\",\n               var = \"cyl\"\n             )\n           )\n\n```\nSave the code above into an Rmd file titled something like param_report_example.Rmd (preferably inside its own folder). Note that at the end of the document, I wrote the lines to render this document inside a chunk that does not get shown to the reader, nor gets evaluated:\n```{r, eval = F, echo = FALSE}\nrmarkdown::render(\n             input = \"param_report_example.Rmd\",\n             params = list(\n               dataset = \"mtcars\",\n               var = \"cyl\"\n             )\n           )\n```\nYou need to run these lines yourself to knit the document.\nThis will pass the list params with elements “mtcars” and “cyl” down to the report. Every params$dataset and params$var in the report gets replaced by “mtcars” and “cyl” respectively. Also, notice that in the header of the document, I defined default values for the params. Something else you need to be aware of, is that the function create_table() inside the report is slightly different than before. It now starts with the following line:\n\ndataset &lt;- get(dataset)\n\nLet’s break this down. params$dataset contains the string “mtcars”. I made the decision to pass the dataset as a string, so that I could use it in the title of the document. But then, inside the create_table() function, I have the following code:\n\ndataset[var]\n\ndataset can’t be a string here, but needs to be a variable name, so mtcars and not \"mtcars\". This means that I need to convert that string into a name. get() searches an object by name, and then makes it possible to save it to a new variable called dataset. The rest of the function is then the same as before. This little difficulty can be avoided by hard-coding the dataset inside the R Markdown file, or by passing the dataset as the params$dataset and not the string, in the render function. However, if you pass down the name of the dataset as a variable instead of the dataset name as a string, then you need to covert it to a string if you want to use it in the text (so mtcars to \"mtcars\", using deparse(substitute(dataset)) as in child documents example).\nIf you instead want to create one report per variable, you could compile all the documents at once with:\n```{r, eval = F, echo = F}\ncolumns &lt;- colnames(mtcars)\n\nlapply(columns,\n  (\\(x)rmarkdown::render(\n                    input = \"param_report_example.Rmd\",\n                    output_file = paste0(\n                      \"param_report_example_\", x, \".html\"\n                    ),\n                    params = list(\n                      dataset = \"mtcars\",\n                      var = x\n                    )\n                  )\n  )\n)\n```\nBy now, this should not intimidate you anymore; I use lapply() to loop over a list of column names (that I get using colnames()). Because I don’t want to overwrite the report I need to change the name of the output file. I do so by using paste0() which creates a new string that contains the variable name, so each report gets its own name. x inside the paste0() function is each element, one after the other, of the columns variable I defined first. Think of it as the i in a for loop. I then must also pass this to the params list, hence the var = x. The complete call to rmarkdown::render() is wrapped inside an anonymous function, because I need to use the argument x (which is each column defined in the columns list) in different places."

    "text": "7.4 Conclusion\nBefore continuing, I highly recommend that you try running this yourself, and also that you try to build your own little parameterised reports. Maybe start by replacing “mtcars” by “iris” in the code to compile the reports and see what happens, and then when you’re comfortable with parameterised reports, try templating inside a parameterised report!\nIt is important not to succumb to the temptation of copy and pasting sections of your report, or parts of your script, instead of using these more advanced features provided by the language. It is tempting, especially under time pressure, to just copy and paste bits of code and get things done instead of writing what seems to be unnecessary code to finally achieve the same thing. The problem however, is that in practice copy and pasting code to simply get things done will come bite you sooner rather than later. Especially when you’re still in the exploration/drafting phase of the project. It may take more time to set up, but once you’re done, it is much easier to experiment with different parameters, test the code or even re-use the code for other projects. Not only that, but forcing you to actually think about how to set up your code in a way that avoids repeating yourself also helps with truly understanding the problem at hand. What part of the problem is constant and does not change? What does change? How often, and why? Can you also fix these parts or not? What if instead of five sections that I need to copy and paste, I had 50 sections? How would I handle this?\nAsking yourself these questions, and solving them, will ultimately make you a better programmer.\nRemember: don’t repeat yourself!\n\n\n\n\nArel-Bundock, Vincent. 2022. “modelsummary: Data and Model Summaries in R.” Journal of Statistical Software 103 (1): 1–23.\n\n\nGohel, David, and Panagiotis Skintzos. 2023.

    "text": "We’re at the end of part 1, and I need to congratulate you for making it this far. If you took the time to digest what we’ve learned up until now, you should be ready for what’s coming, which should be a bit easier, at least some of the parts.\nBut before continuing, let’s quickly summarise what we’ve learned so far.\nWe started our journey with two scripts that download and analyse data about housing in Luxembourg. We then learned about tools and programming paradigms that we will now use in part 2 to make our scripts more robust:\n\nVersion control;\nFunctional programming;\nLiterate programming.\n\nIn some ways, you might think that we’ve made our life unnecessarily complicated for very little gain. For example, functional programming seems to be only about putting restrictions on how you code. Same with using trunk-based development; why make it so restrictive?\nWhat you need to understand is that these restrictions actually play a role. They force us to work in a much more structured way, which then ensures that our projects will be well-managed and ultimately reproducible. So while these techniques come with a cost, the benefits are far greater.\nWe will start part 2 by rewriting our scripts using what we’ve learned, and then, we will think about approaching the core problem differently, and structuring our project not as a series of scripts (or R Markdown files in the case of literate programming) but instead as a pipeline. Because until now, there’s no still pipeline and let me remind you that this book as the word “pipeline” in its title.\nWe will also learn about tools that capture the computational environment that was used to set up this pipeline and how to use them effectively to make sure that our project is reproducible."

    "section": "The reproducibility iceberg",
    "text": "The reproducibility iceberg\nI think it is time to reflect on why I bothered with the first part of the book at all, because for now, I didn’t really teach you anything directly related to reproducibility, so why didn’t I just jump straight to the reproducibility part?\nRemember the introduction, where I talked about the reproducibility continuum or spectrum? It is now time to discuss this in greater detail. I propose a new analogy, the reproducibility iceberg:\n\n\n\nThe reproducibility iceberg.\n\n\nWhy an iceberg? Because the parts of the iceberg that you see, those that are obvious, are like running your analyses in a click-based environment like Excel. This is what’s obvious, what’s easy. No special knowledge or even training is required. All that’s required is time, so people using these tools are not efficient and thus compensate by working insane hours (I can’t go home and enjoy time with my family I have to stay at the office and update the spreadsheeeeeeeeet clicks furiously).\nLet’s go one level deeper: let’s write a script. This is where we started. Our script was not too bad, it did the job. Unlike a click-based workflow, we could at least re-read it, someone else could read it, and it would be possible to run in the future but likely with some effort unless we’re lucky. By that, I mean that for such a script to run successfully in the future, that script cannot rely on packages that got updated in such a way that the script cannot run anymore (for example, if functions get renamed, or if their arguments get renamed). Furthermore, if that script relies on a data source, the original authors also have to make sure that the same data source stays available. Another issue is collaborating when writing this script. Without any version control tools nor code hosting platform, collaborating on this script can very quickly turn into a nightmare.\nThis is where Git and Github.com came into play, one level deeper. The advantage now is that collaboration was streamlined. The commit history is available to all the teammates and it is possible to revert changes, experiment with new features using branches and overall manage the project. In this layer we also employ new programming paradigms to make the code of the project less verbose, using functional programming, with the added benefits of making it easier to test, document and share (which we will discuss to its fullest in this part of the book). Using literate programming, it is also much easier to go to our final output (which is usually a report). We implemented DRY ideas to the fullest to ensure that our code was of high quality.\nAt this depth, we are at a pivotal moment: in many cases, analysts may want to stop here because there is no more time or budget left. After all, the results were obtained and shared with higher-ups. It can be difficult, in some contexts, to justify spending more time to go deeper and write tests, documentation and otherwise ensure total reproducibility. So at this stage, we will see what we can do that is very cheap (in both time and effort) to ensure the minimal amount of reproducibility, which is recording packages versions. Recording packages means that the exact same versions of the packages that were used originally will get used regardless of when in the future we rerun the analysis.\nBut if budget and time allow we can still go deeper, and definitely should. One day, you will want to update your script to use the newest functionality of your preferred package, but with package version recording, you will be stuck in the past with a very old version and its dependencies. How will you know that upgrading this package will not break anything anywhere in your workflow? Also, we want to make running the script as easy as possible, and ideally, as non-interactively as possible. Indeed, any human interaction with the analysis is a source of errors. That’s why we need to thoroughly and systematically test our code. These tests also need to run non-interactively. Using the tools described in part two of this book, we can actually set up the project, right from the very beginning, in a way that it will be reproducible quite naturally. By using the right tools and setting things up right, we don’t really need to invest more time to make things reproducible. The project will simply be reproducible because it was engineered that way. And I insist, at practically no additional cost!\nAnother problem with only recording packages’s version is that in practice, it is very often not enough. This is because installing older versions of packages can be a challenge. This can be the case for two reasons:\n\nThese older packages need also an older version of R, and installing old versions of R can be tricky, depending on your operating system;\nThese older packages might need to get compiled and thus depend themselves on older versions of development libraries needed for compilation.\n\nSo to solve this issue, we will also need a way to freeze the computational environment itself, and this is where we will use Docker.\nFinally, and this is the last level of the iceberg and not part of this book, is the need to make the building of the computational environment reproducible as well. Guix is the tool that enables one to do just that. However, this is a very deep topic unto itself, and there are workarounds to achieve this using Docker, so that’s why we will not be discussing Guix.\nWe will travel down the iceberg in the coming chapters. First, we will use what we’ve learned up until now to rewrite our project using functional and literate programming. Our project will not be two scripts anymore, but two Rmarkdown files that we can knit and that we can then read and also send to non-technical stakeholders.\nThen, we are going to turn these two Rmds files into a package. This will be done by using Sébastien Rochette’s package {fusen}1. {fusen} makes it very easy to go from our Rmd files to a package, by using what Sébastien named the Rmarkdown first method. If at this stage it’s not clear why you would want to turn your analysis into a package, don’t worry, it’ll be once we’re done with this chapter.\nOnce we have a package, we can use {testthat} for unit testing, and base R functions for assertive programming. At this stage, our code should be well-documented, easy to share, and thoroughly tested.\nI think I should emphasize the following: I started from very simple scripts, which is how most analyses are done. Then, using functional and literate programming, these scripts got turned into RMarkdown files, and in this part of the book these RMarkdown files will get turned into a package. It is important to understand the following point: I did this to illustrate how we can go from these simple scripts to something more robust, step by step. Of course, later, you can immediately start from either the RMarkdown files or from the package. My advice is to start from the package, because as you shall see, starting from the package is basically the same amount of effort as starting from a simple RMarkdown file, thanks to {fusen}, but now you have the added benefits of using package development facilities to improve your analysis.\nOnce you have the package, you can build a true pipeline using {targets}, an incredibly useful library for build automation (but if you prefer to keep it at simple RMarkdown files, you can also use {targets}, you don’t have to build a package).\nOnce we reached this stage, this is when we can finally start introducing reproducibility concretely. The reason it will take so long to actually make our pipeline reproducible is that we need solid foundations. There is no point in making a shaky analysis reproducible."

    "section": "9.1 An Rmd for cleaning the data",
    "text": "9.1 An Rmd for cleaning the data\nSo, let’s start with the save_data.R script. Since we are going to use functional programming and literate programming, we are going to start from an empty .Rmd file. So open an empty .Rmd file and start with the following lines:\n---\ntitle: \"Nominal house prices data in Luxembourg - Data cleaning\"\nauthor: \"Put your name in here\"\ndate: \"`r Sys.Date()`\"\n---\n\n```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(purrr)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(rvest)\nlibrary(stringr)\n```\n\n\n## Downloading the data\nWe start by writing a header to define the title of the document, the name of the author and the current date using inline R code (you can also hardcode the date as a string if you prefer). We then load packages in a chunk with options warning=FALSE and message=FALSE which will avoid showing packages’ startup messages in the knitted document.\nThen we start with a new section called ## Downloading the data. We then add a paragraph explaining from where and how we are going to download the data:\nThis data is downloaded from the luxembourguish [Open Data\nPortal](https://data.public.lu/fr/datasets/prix-annonces-des-logements-par-commune/)\n(the data set called *Série rétrospective des prix\nannoncés des maisons par commune, de 2010 à 2021*), \nand the original data is from the \"Observatoire de\nl'habitat\". This data contains prices for houses sold \nsince 2010 for each luxembourguish commune. \n\nThe function below uses the permanent URL from the Open Data \nPortal to access the data, but I have also rehosted the data, \nand use my link to download the data (for archival purposes):\nThis is much more detailed than using comments in a script, one of the benefits of literate programming. Then comes a function to download and get the data. This function simply wraps the lines from our original script that did the downloading and the cleaning. As a reminder, here are the lines from the original script, which I will then rewrite as a function:\n\nurl &lt;- \"https://is.gd/1vvBAc\"\n\nraw_data &lt;- tempfile(fileext = \".xlsx\")\n\ndownload.file(url, raw_data, method = \"auto\", mode = \"wb\")\n\nsheets &lt;- excel_sheets(raw_data)\n\nread_clean &lt;- function(..., sheet){\n  read_excel(..., sheet = sheet) |&gt;\n    mutate(year = sheet)\n\n  raw_data &lt;- map(\n    sheets,\n    ~read_clean(raw_data,\n                skip = 10,\n                sheet = .)\n  ) |&gt;\n    bind_rows() |&gt;\n    clean_names()\n\n  raw_data &lt;- raw_data |&gt;\n   rename(\n     locality = commune,\n     n_offers = nombre_doffres,\n     average_price_nominal_euros = prix_moyen_annonce_en_courant,\n     average_price_m2_nominal_euros = prix_moyen_annonce_au_m2_en_courant,\n     average_price_m2_nominal_euros = prix_moyen_annonce_au_m2_en_courant\n   ) |&gt;\n    mutate(locality = str_trim(locality)) |&gt;\n    select(year, locality, n_offers, starts_with(\"average\"))\n\nand here is the same code, but as a function:\n```{r, eval = FALSE}\nget_raw_data &lt;- function(url = \"https://is.gd/1vvBAc\"){\n\n  raw_data &lt;- tempfile(fileext = \".xlsx\")\n\n  download.file(url,\n                raw_data,\n                mode = \"wb\")\n\n  sheets &lt;- excel_sheets(raw_data)\n\n  read_clean &lt;- function(..., sheet){\n    read_excel(..., sheet = sheet) %&gt;%\n      mutate(year = sheet)\n  }\n\n  raw_data &lt;- map_dfr(\n    sheets,\n    ~read_clean(raw_data,\n                skip = 10,\n                sheet = .)) %&gt;%\n    clean_names()\n\n  raw_data %&gt;%\n    rename(\n      locality = commune,\n      n_offers = nombre_doffres,\n      average_price_nominal_euros = prix_moyen_annonce_en_courant,\n      average_price_m2_nominal_euros = prix_moyen_annonce_au_m2_en_courant,\n      average_price_m2_nominal_euros = prix_moyen_annonce_au_m2_en_courant\n           ) %&gt;%\n    mutate(locality = str_trim(locality)) %&gt;%\n    select(year, locality, n_offers, starts_with(\"average\"))\n\n}\n```\nAs you see, it’s almost exactly the same code. So why use a function? Our function has the advantage that it uses the url of the data as an argument. Which means that we can use it on other datasets (let’s remember that we are here focusing on prices of houses, but there’s another dataset of prices of apartments) or use it on an updated version of this dataset (which gets updated yearly). We can now more easily re-use this function later on (especially once we’ve turned this Rmd into a package in the next chapter). You can decide to show the source code of the function or hide it with the chunk option include=FALSE or echo=FALSE (the difference between include and echo is that include hides both the source code chunk and the output of that chunk). Showing the source code in the output of your Rmd file can be useful if you want to share it with other developers. The next part of the Rmd file is simply using the function we just wrote:\n```{r}\nraw_data &lt;- get_raw_data(url = \"https://is.gd/1vvBAc\")\n```\nWe can now continue by explaining what’s wrong with the data and what cleaning steps need to be taken:\nWe need clean the data: \"Luxembourg\" is \"Luxembourg-ville\" in 2010 and 2011,\nthen \"Luxembourg\". \"Pétange\" is also spelled non-consistently, and we also need\nto convert columns to the right type. We also directly remove rows where the\nlocality contains information on the \"Source\":\n\n```{r}\nclean_raw_data &lt;- function(raw_data){\n  raw_data %&gt;%\n    mutate(locality = ifelse(grepl(\"Luxembourg-Ville\", locality),\n                             \"Luxembourg\",\n                             locality),\n           locality = ifelse(grepl(\"P.tange\", locality),\n                             \"Pétange\",\n                             locality)\n           ) %&gt;%\n    filter(!grepl(\"Source\", locality)) %&gt;%\n    mutate(across(starts_with(\"average\"), as.numeric))\n}\n```\n\n```{r}\nflat_data &lt;- clean_raw_data(raw_data)\n```\nThe chunk above explains what we’re doing and why we’re doing it, and so we write a function (based on what we already wrote). Here again, the advantage of having this as a function will make it easier to run on updated data.\nWe now continue with establishing a list of communes:\nWe now need to make sure that we got all the communes/localities \nin there. There were mergers in 2011, 2015 and 2018. So we need \nto account for these localities.\n\nWe’re now scraping data from Wikipedia of former Luxembourguish communes:\n\n```{r}\nget_former_communes &lt;- function(\n            url = \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communes_of_Luxembourg#Former_communes\",\n            min_year = 2009,\n            table_position = 3\n            ){\n\n  read_html(url) %&gt;%\n    html_table() %&gt;%\n    pluck(table_position) %&gt;%\n    clean_names() %&gt;%\n    filter(year_dissolved &gt; min_year)\n}\n\n```\n\n```{r}\nformer_communes &lt;- get_former_communes()\n```\n\nWe can scrape current communes:\n\n```{r}\nget_current_communes &lt;- function(\n                 url = \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_communes_of_Luxembourg\",\n                 table_position = 1\n                 ){\n\n  read_html(url) %&gt;%\n    html_table() %&gt;%\n    pluck(table_position) %&gt;%\n    clean_names()\n}\n\n```\n\n```{r}\ncurrent_communes &lt;- get_current_communes()\n```\nThis is quite a long chunk, but there is nothing new in here, so I won’t explain it line by line. What’s important is that the code doing the actual work is all being wrapped inside functions. I reiterate: this will make reusing, testing and documenting much easier later on. Using the object former_communes and current_communes we can now build the complete list:\nLet’s now create a list of all communes:\n\n```{r}\nget_test_communes &lt;- function(former_communes, current_communes){\n\n  communes &lt;- unique(c(former_communes$name, current_communes$commune))\n  # we need to rename some communes\n\n  # Different spelling of these communes between wikipedia and the data\n\n  communes[which(communes == \"Clemency\")] &lt;- \"Clémency\"\n  communes[which(communes == \"Redange\")] &lt;- \"Redange-sur-Attert\"\n  communes[which(communes == \"Erpeldange-sur-Sûre\")] &lt;- \"Erpeldange\"\n  communes[which(communes == \"Luxembourg-City\")] &lt;- \"Luxembourg\"\n  communes[which(communes == \"Käerjeng\")] &lt;- \"Kaerjeng\"\n  communes[which(communes == \"Petange\")] &lt;- \"Pétange\"\n\n  communes\n}\n\n```\n\n```{r}\nformer_communes &lt;- get_former_communes()\ncurrent_communes &lt;- get_current_communes()\n\ncommunes &lt;- get_test_communes(former_communes, current_communes)\n```\nOnce again, we write a function for this. We need to merge these two lists, and need to make sure that the spelling of the communes’ names is unified between this list and between the communes’ names in the data.\nWe now run the actual test:\nLet’s test to see if all the communes from our dataset are represented.\n\n```{r}\nsetdiff(flat_data$locality, communes)\n```\n\nIf the above code doesn’t show any communes, then this means that we are\naccounting for every commune.\nThis test is quite simple, and we will see how to create something a bit more robust and useful later on.\nNow, let’s extract the national average from the data and create a separate dataset with the national level data:\n\nLet’s keep the national average in another dataset:\n\n```{r}\nmake_country_level_data &lt;- function(flat_data){\n  country_level &lt;- flat_data %&gt;%\n    filter(grepl(\"nationale\", locality)) %&gt;%\n    select(-n_offers)\n\n  offers_country &lt;- flat_data %&gt;%\n    filter(grepl(\"Total d.offres\", locality)) %&gt;%\n    select(year, n_offers)\n\n  full_join(country_level, offers_country) %&gt;%\n    select(year, locality, n_offers, everything()) %&gt;%\n    mutate(locality = \"Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg\")\n\n}\n\n```\n\n```{r}\ncountry_level_data &lt;- make_country_level_data(flat_data)\n```\nand finally, let’s do the same but for the commune level data:\nWe can finish cleaning the commune data:\n\n```{r}\nmake_commune_level_data &lt;- function(flat_data){\n  flat_data %&gt;%\n    filter(!grepl(\"nationale|offres\", locality),\n           !is.na(locality))\n}\n\n```\n\n```{r}\ncommune_level_data &lt;- make_commune_level_data(flat_data)\n```\nWe can finish with a chunk to save the data to disk:\nWe now save the dataset in a folder for further analysis (keep chunk option to\n`eval = FALSE` to avoid running it when knitting):\n\n```{r, eval = FALSE}\nwrite.csv(commune_level_data,\n          \"datasets/house_prices_commune_level_data.csv\",\n          row.names = FALSE)\nwrite.csv(country_level_data,\n          \"datasets/house_prices_country_level_data.csv\",\n          row.names = FALSE)\n```\nThis last chunk is something I like to add to my Rmd files.\nInstead of showing it in the final document but not evaluating its contents using the chunk option eval = FALSE, like I did, you could use include = FALSE, so it doesn’t appear in the compiled document at all. The first time you compile this document, you could change the option to eval = TRUE, so that the data gets written to disk, and then change it to eval = FALSE to avoid overwriting the data on subsequent knittings. This is up to you, and it also depends on who the audience of the knitted output is (do they want to see this chunk at all?).\nOk, and that’s it. You can take a look at the finalised file here1. You can now remove the save_data.R script, as you have successfully ported the code over to a Rmd.\nIf you have not done it yet, you can commit these changes and push.\nLet’s now do the same thing for the analysis script."

    "section": "9.2 An Rmd for analysing the data",
    "text": "9.2 An Rmd for analysing the data\nWe will follow the same steps as before to convert the analysis script into an analysis RMarkdown file. Instead of showing the whole file here, I will show you two important points.\nThe first point is removing redundancy. In the original script, we had the following lines:\n\n#Let’s compute the Laspeyeres index for each commune:\n\ncommune_level_data &lt;- commune_level_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(locality) %&gt;%\n  mutate(p0 = ifelse(year == \"2010\",\n                     average_price_nominal_euros,\n                     NA)) %&gt;%\n  fill(p0, .direction = \"down\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(p0_m2 = ifelse(year == \"2010\",\n                        average_price_m2_nominal_euros,\n                        NA)) %&gt;%\n  fill(p0_m2, .direction = \"down\") %&gt;%\n  ungroup() %&gt;%\n  mutate(pl = average_price_nominal_euros/p0*100,\n         pl_m2 = average_price_m2_nominal_euros/p0_m2*100)\n\n\n#Let’s also compute it for the whole country:\n\ncountry_level_data &lt;- country_level_data %&gt;%\n  mutate(p0 = ifelse(year == \"2010\",\n                     average_price_nominal_euros,\n                     NA)) %&gt;%\n  fill(p0, .direction = \"down\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(p0_m2 = ifelse(year == \"2010\",\n                        average_price_m2_nominal_euros,\n                        NA)) %&gt;%\n  fill(p0_m2, .direction = \"down\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(pl = average_price_nominal_euros/p0*100,\n         pl_m2 = average_price_m2_nominal_euros/p0_m2*100)\n\nAs you can see, this is almost exactly the same code twice. The only difference between the two code snippets, is that we need to group by commune when computing the Laspeyeres index for the communes (remember, this index will make it easy to make comparisons). Instead of repeating 99% of the lines, we should create a function that will group the data if the data is the commune level data, and not group the data if it’s the national data. Here is this function:\n\nget_laspeyeres &lt;- function(dataset, start_year = \"2010\"){\n\n  which_dataset &lt;- deparse(substitute(dataset))\n\n  group_var &lt;- if(grepl(\"commune\", which_dataset)){\n                 quo(locality)\n               } else {\n                 NULL\n               }\n  dataset %&gt;%\n    group_by(!!group_var) %&gt;%\n    mutate(p0 = ifelse(year == start_year,\n                       average_price_nominal_euros,\n                       NA)) %&gt;%\n    fill(p0, .direction = \"down\") %&gt;%\n    mutate(p0_m2 = ifelse(year == start_year,\n                          average_price_m2_nominal_euros,\n                          NA)) %&gt;%\n    fill(p0_m2, .direction = \"down\") %&gt;%\n    ungroup() %&gt;%\n    mutate(pl = average_price_nominal_euros/p0*100,\n           pl_m2 = average_price_m2_nominal_euros/p0_m2*100)\n\n}\n\nSo, the first step is naming the function. We’ll call it get_laspeyeres(), and it’ll be a function of two arguments. The first is the data (commune or national level data) and the second is the starting date of the data. This second argument has a default value of “2010”. This is the year the data starts, and so this the year the Laspeyeres index will have a value of 100.\nThe following lines are probably the most complicated:\n\nwhich_dataset &lt;- deparse(substitute(dataset))\n\ngroup_var &lt;- if(grepl(\"commune\", which_dataset)){\n               quo(locality)\n             } else {\n               NULL\n             }\n\nThe first line replaces the variable dataset by its bound value (that’s what substitute() does) for example, commune_level_data, and then converts this variable name into a string (using deparse()). So when the user provides commune_level_data, which_dataset will be defined as equal to \"commune_level_data\". We then use this string to detect whether the data needs to be grouped or not. So if we detect the word “commune” in the which_dataset variable, we set the grouping variable to locality, if not to NULL. But you might have the following questions: why is locality given as an input to quo(), and what is quo()?\nA simple explanation: locality is a variable in the commune_level_dataset. If we don’t quote it using quo(), our function will look for a variable called locality in body of the function, but since there is no variable defined that is called locality in there, the function will look for this variable in the global environment. But this is not a variable defined in the global environment either, it is a column in our dataset. So we need a way to tell this to our function: don’t worry about evaluating this just yet, I’ll tell you when it’s time.\nSo by using quo(), we can delay evaluation. So how can we tell the function that it’s time to evaluate locality? This is where we need !! (pronounced bang-bang). You’ll see that !! gets used on group_var inside locality:\n\ngroup_by(!!group_var)\n\nSo if we are calling the function on commune_level_dataset, then group_var is equal to locality, if not it’s NULL. !!group_var means that now it’s time to evaluate group_var (or rather, locality). Because !!group_var gets replaced by quo(locality), and because group_by() is a {dplyr} function that knows how to deal with quoted variables, locality gets looked up among the columns of the data frame. If it’s NULL nothing happens, so the data doesn’t get grouped.\nThis is a big topic unto itself, so if you want to know more you can start by reading the famous {dplyr} vignette called Programming with dplyr here2. In case you use {dplyr} a lot, I recommend you study this vignette because mastering tidy evaluation (the name of this framework) is key to becoming comfortable with programming using {dplyr} (and other tidyverse packages). You can also read the chapter I wrote on this in my other free ebook3.\nThe next lines of the script that we need to port over to the Rmd are quite standard, we write code to create some plots (which were already refactored into a function in the chapter on collaborating on Github). But remember, we want to have an Rmd file that can be compiled into a document that can be read by humans. This means that to make the document clear, I suggest that we create one subsection by commune that we plot. Thankfully, we have learned all about child documents in the literate programming chapter, and this is what we will be using to avoid having to repeat ourselves. The first part is simply the function that we’ve already written:\n```{r}\nmake_plot &lt;- function(commune){\n\n  commune_data &lt;- commune_level_data %&gt;%\n    filter(locality == commune)\n\n  data_to_plot &lt;- bind_rows(\n    country_level_data,\n    commune_data\n  )\n\n  ggplot(data_to_plot) +\n    geom_line(aes(y = pl_m2,\n                  x = year,\n                  group = locality,\n                  colour = locality))\n}\n\n```\nNow comes the interesting part:\n```{r, results = \"asis\"}\nres &lt;- lapply(communes, function(x){\n\n  knitr::knit_child(text = c(\n\n    '\\n',\n    '## Plot for commune: `r x`',\n    '\\n',\n    '```{r, echo = FALSE}',\n    'print(make_plot(x))',\n    '```'\n\n     ),\n     envir = environment(),\n     quiet = TRUE)\n\n})\n\ncat(unlist(res), sep = \"\\n\")\n\n```\nI won’t explain this now in great detail, since that was already done in the chapter on literate programming. Before continuing, really make sure that you understand what is going on here. Take a look at the finalised file here4. You’ll notice that at the start of the RMarkdown file, I also load some package and the data saved by the save_data.Rmd RMarkdown file.\nYou can see how the outputs look like by browsing to the links below:\n\nsave_data.html, compiled from the save_data.Rmd source5\nanalyse_data.html, compiled from the analyse_data.Rmd source6\n\nOf course, you could compile the files into Word documents or PDF, depending on your needs, and you could of course write many more details than me. I wanted to keep it short; the point of this chapter was to show you how to use literate programming and not to write a very detailed analysis."

    "text": "9.3 Conclusion\nThis chapter was short, but quite dense, especially when we converted the analysis script to an Rmd, because we’ve had to use two advanced concepts, tidy evaluation and Rmarkdown child documents. Tidy evaluation is not a topic that I wanted to discuss in this book, because it doesn’t have anything to do with the main topic at hand. However, part of building a robust, reproducible pipeline is to avoid repetition. In this sense, programming with {dplyr} and tidy evaluation are quite important. As suggested before, take a look at the linked vignette above, and then the chapter from my other free ebook. This should help get you started.\nThe end of this chapter marks an important step: many analyses stop here, and this can be due to a variety of reasons. Maybe there’s no time left to go further, and after all, you’ve got the results you wanted. Maybe this analysis is useful, but you don’t necessarily need it to be reproducible in 5, 10 years, so all you want is to make sure that you can at least rerun it in some months or only a couple of years later (but be careful with this assessment, sometimes an analysis that wasn’t supposed to be reproducible for too long turns out to need to be reproducible for way longer than expected…).\nBecause I want this book to be a pragmatic guide, I will now talk about putting the least amount of effort to make your current analysis reproducible, and this is by freezing package versions, which I will show you in the next chapter."

    "text": "10.1 Recording packages’ version with {renv}\nSo now that you’ve used functional and literate programming, we need to start thinking about the infrastructure surrounding our code. By infrastructure I mean:\n\nthe R version;\nthe packages used for the analysis;\nand otherwise the whole computational environment, even the computer hardware itself.\n\n{renv} enables you to create Reproducible Environments and is a package that takes care of point number 2: it allows you to easily record the packages that were used for a specific project. This record is a file called renv.lock which will appear at the root of your project once you’ve set up {renv} and run it. You can use {renv} once you’re done with an analysis like in our case, or better yet, immediately at the start of the project. You can keep updating the renv.lock file as you add or remove packages from your analysis. The renv.lock file can then be used to restore the exact same package library that was used for your analysis on another computer, or on the same computer but in the future.\nThis works because {renv} does more than simply create a list of the used packages and recording their versions inside the renv.lock file: it actually creates a per-project library that is completely isolated for the main, default, R library on your machine, but also from the other {renv} libraries that you might have set up for your other projects (remember, the library is the set of R packages installed on your computer). To save time when setting up an {renv} library, packages simply get copied over from your main library instead of being re-downloaded and re-installed (if the required packages are already installed in your default library).\nTo get started, install the {renv} package (make sure to start a fresh R session):\n\ninstall.packages(\"renv\")\n\nand then go to the folder containing the Rmds we wrote together in the previous chapter. Make sure that you have the two following files in that folder:\n\nsave_data.Rmd, the script that downloads and prepares the data;\nanalyse_data.Rmd, the script that analyses the data.\n\nAlso, make sure that the changes are correctly backed up on Github.com, so if you haven’t already, commit and push any change to the rmd branch. Because we will be experimenting with a new feature, create a new branch called renv. You should know the drill by now, but if not simply follow along:\nowner@localhost ➤ git checkout -b renv\nSwitched to a new branch 'renv'\nWe will now be working on this branch. Simply work as usual, but when pushing, make sure to push to the renv branch:\nowner@localhost ➤ git add .\nowner@localhost ➤ git commit -m \"some changes\"\nowner@localhost ➤ git push origin renv\nOnce this is done, start an R session, and simply type the following in a console:\n\nrenv::init()\n\nYou should see the following:\n\n* Initializing project ...\n* Discovering package dependencies ... Done!\n* Copying packages into the cache ... [76/76] Done!\nThe following package(s) will be updated in the lockfile:\n\n# CRAN ===============================\n***and then a long list of packages***\n\nThe version of R recorded in the lockfile will be updated:\n- R              [*] -&gt; [4.2.2]\n\n* Lockfile written to 'path/to/housing/renv.lock'.\n* Project 'path/to/housing' loaded. [renv 0.16.0]\n* renv activated -- please restart the R session.\n\nLet’s take a look at the files that were created (if you prefer using your file browser, feel free to do so, but I prefer the command line):\nowner@localhost ➤ ls -la\ntotal 1070\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 owner Domain Users     0 Feb 27 12:44 .\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 owner Domain Users     0 Feb 27 12:35 ..\n-rw-r--r-- 1 owner Domain Users    27 Feb 27 12:44 .Rprofile\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 owner Domain Users     0 Feb 27 12:40 .git\n-rw-r--r-- 1 owner Domain Users   306 Feb 27 12:35 README.md\n-rw-r--r-- 1 owner Domain Users  2398 Feb 27 12:38 analyse_data.Rmd\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 owner Domain Users     0 Feb 27 12:44 renv\n-rw-r--r-- 1 owner Domain Users 20502 Feb 27 12:44 renv.lock\n-rw-r--r-- 1 owner Domain Users  6378 Feb 27 12:38 save_data.Rmd\nAs you can see, there are two new files and one folder. The new files are the renv.lock file that I mentioned before and a file called .Rprofile. The new folder is simply called renv. The renv.lock is the file that lists all the packages used for the analysis. .Rprofile files are files that get read by R automatically at startup (as discussed at the very beginning of part one of this book). You should have a system-wide one that gets read on startups of R, but if R discovers an .Rprofile file in the directory it starts on, then that file gets read instead. Let’s see the contents of this file (you can open this file in any text editor, like Notepad on Windows, but then again I prefer the command line):\nowner@localhost ➤ cat .Rprofile\nThe files contains the single line:\nsource(\"renv/activate.R\")\nactivate.R is an R script that was also create by renv::init(), which you can find in the renv folder. Let’s take a look at the contents of this folder:\nowner@localhost ➤ ls renv\ntotal 107\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 owner Domain Users     0 Feb 27 12:44 .\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 owner Domain Users     0 Feb 27 12:35 ..\n-rw-r--r-- 1 owner Domain Users    27 Feb 27 12:44 activate.R\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 owner Domain Users     0 Feb 27 12:40 .gitignore\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 owner Domain Users     0 Feb 27 12:40 library\n-rw-r--r-- 1 owner Domain Users  6378 Feb 27 12:38 settings.dcf\nSo inside the renv folder, there is another folder called library: this is the folder that contains our isolated library for just this project. That’s something that we would not want to back up on Github as it grows quite large. To avoid tracking this folder and backing it up on Github.com a file called .gitignore (notice the . at the start of the name) gets used. This is a file that contains the paths to other files and folders that should be ignored. If you open it, you will see that the library/ folder is listed there so it will be ignored. You can have as many .gitignore files as necessary, but if you put one on the root folder of your project, then that .gitignore will work project-wide.\nFor example, if you are working with sensitive data, you could also add a .gitignore file in the root of the project’s directory, and simply list the folder containing he sensitive data. Create this file using your favourite text editor and simply add, for example if you’re working with sensitive data, the following:\ndatasets/\nThis will prevent the datasets/ folder from being tracked and backed up.\nLet’s restart a fresh R session in our project’s directory; you should see the following startup message:\n\n* Project 'path/to/housing' loaded. [renv 0.16.0]\n\nThis means that this R session will use the packages installed in the isolated library we’ve just created. Let’s now take a look at the renv.lock file:\nowner@localhost ➤ cat renv.lock\n{\n  \"R\": {\n    \"Version\": \"4.2.2\",\n    \"Repositories\": [\n      {\n        \"Name\": \"CRAN\",\n        \"URL\": \"https://packagemanager.rstudio.com/all/latest\"\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  \"Packages\": {\n    \"MASS\": {\n      \"Package\": \"MASS\",\n      \"Version\": \"7.3-58.1\",\n      \"Source\": \"Repository\",\n      \"Repository\": \"CRAN\",\n      \"Hash\": \"762e1804143a332333c054759f89a706\",\n      \"Requirements\": []\n    },\n    \"Matrix\": {\n      \"Package\": \"Matrix\",\n      \"Version\": \"1.5-1\",\n      \"Source\": \"Repository\",\n      \"Repository\": \"CRAN\",\n      \"Hash\": \"539dc0c0c05636812f1080f473d2c177\",\n      \"Requirements\": [\n        \"lattice\"\n      ]\n\n      ***and many more packages***\nThe renv.lock file is a json file listing all the packages, as well as their dependencies, that are used for the project. At the top of the file, the R version that was used to generate the renv.lock file is also named. It is important to remember that when you’ll use {renv} to restore a project’s library on a new machine, the R version will not be restored: so in the future, you might be restoring this project and run old versions of packages on a newer version of R, which may sometimes be a problem (but we’re going to discuss this later).\nSo… that’s it. You’ve generated the renv.lock file, which means that future you, or someone else can restore the library that you used to write this analysis. All that’s required is for that person (or future you) to install {renv} and then use the renv.lock file that you generated to restore the library. Let’s see how this works by cloning the following Github repository on this link1 (forked from this one here2):\nowner@localhost ➤ git clone git@github.com:b-rodrigues/targets-minimal.git\nYou should see a targets-minimal folder on your computer now. Start an R session in that folder and type the following command:\n\nrenv::restore()\n\nYou should be prompted to activate the project before restoring:\n\nThis project has not yet been activated.\nActivating this project will ensure the project library\nis used during restore.\nPlease see `?renv::activate` for more details.\n\nWould you like to activate this project before restore? [Y/n]: \n\nType Y and you should see a list of packages that need to be installed. You’ll get asked once more if you want to proceed, type y and watch as the packages get installed. If you pay attention to the links, you should see that many of them get pulled from the CRAN archive, for example:\nRetrieving\n  'https://cloud.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/vroom/vroom_1.5.5.tar.gz' ...\nNotice the word “Archive” in the url? That’s because this project uses {vroom} 1.5.5, but as of writing (early 2023), {vroom} is at version 1.6.1.\nNow, maybe you’ve run renv::restore(), but the installation of the packages may have failed. If that’s the case, let me explain what likely happened.\nI tried restoring the project’s library on two different machines: a Windows laptop and a Linux workstation. renv::restore() failed on the Windows laptop, but succeeded on the Linux workstation.\nWhy does that happen? Well in the case of the Windows laptop, compilation of the {dplyr} package failed. This is likely because my Windows laptop does not have the right version of Rtools installed. If you look inside the renv.lock file that came with the targets-minimal project, you should notice that the recorded R version is 4.1.0, but I’m running R 4.2.2 on my computers. So libraries get compiled using Rtools 4.2 and not Rtools 4.0 (which includes the libraries for R 4.1 as well).\nSo in order to run this project successfully, I should install the right version of R and Rtools and on Windows that should not be too complicated. But that might be a problem on other operating systems. Does that mean that {renv} is useless? No, not at all.\nAt a minimum, {renv} ensures that a project’s library doesn’t interfere with another project’s library while you’re working on different projects. You can be working on several projects and be sure that if you update your library (for example, to use a nice new function from one specific package), that update will only affect the project where the library was updated, and not the other libraries from the other projects. When working with a system-wide library, updating packages for a project could introduce breaks in other projects. Without {renv}, such breaks could happen because another function coming from some other package that also got updated and that you use in another long-term project got removed, or renamed, or simply works differently now. This types of issues can be avoided by using a per-project library, which is exactly what {renv} does.\nBut also, apart from that already quite useful feature, renv.lock files provide a very useful blueprint for Docker, which we are going to explore in a future chapter. Only to give you a little taste of what’s coming: since the renv.lock file lists the R version that was used to record the packages, we can start from a Docker image that contains the right version of R. From there, restoring the project using renv::restore() should succeed without issues. If you have no idea what this all means, do not worry, you will know by the end of the book, so hang in there.\nSo should you use {renv}? I see two scenarios where it makes sense:\n\nYou’re done with the project and simply want to keep a record of the packages used. Simply call renv::init() at the end of the project and commit and push the renv.lock file on Github.\nYou want to use {renv} from the start to isolate the project’s library from your whole R installation’s library to avoid any interference (I would advise you to do it like this).\n\nIn the next section, we’ll quickly review how to use {renv} on a “daily basis”.\n\n10.1.1 Daily {renv} usage\nSo let’s say that you start a new project and want to use {renv} right from the start. You start with an empty directory, and add a template .Rmd file, and let’s say it looks like this:\n---\ntitle: \"My new project\"\noutput: html_document\n---\n\n```{r setup, include=FALSE}\nlibrary(dplyr)\n```\n\n\n## Overview\n\n## Analysis\nBefore continuing, make sure that it correctly compiles into a HTML file by running rmarkdown::render(\"test.Rmd\") in the correct directory.\nIn the setup chunk you load the packages that you need. Now, save this file, and start a fresh session in the same directory and run renv::init(). You should see the familiar prompts described above, as well as the renv.lock file (which will only contain {dplyr} and its dependencies).\nNow, after the library(dplyr) line, add the following library(ggplot2) (or any other package that you use on a daily basis). Make sure to save the .Rmd file and try to render it again by using rmarkdown::render(\"test.Rmd\") (or if you’re using RStudio, by clicking the right button), but, spoiler alert, it won’t work. Instead you should see this:\nQuitting from lines 7-9 (my_new_project.Rmd)\nError in library(ggplot2) : there is no package called 'ggplot2'\nDon’t be confused: remember that {renv} is now activated, and that each project where {renv} is enabled has its own project-specific library. You may have {ggplot2} installed on your system-wide library, but this {renv}-enabled project does not have it yet on its own specific library. This means that you need to install {ggplot2} for your project. To do so, simply start an R session within your project and run install.packages(\"ggplot2\"). If the version installed on your system-wide library is the latest version available on CRAN, the package will simply be copied over from the system-wide to the project-specific library, if not, the latest version will be downloaded onto your project’s library. You can now update the renv.lock file. This is done using renv::snapshot(); this will show you a list of new packages to record inside the renv.lock file and ask you to continue:\n\n**list of many packages over here**\n\nDo you want to proceed? [y/N]: \n* Lockfile written to 'path/to/my_new_project/renv.lock'.\n\nIf you now open the renv.lock file, and look for the string \"ggplot2\" you should see it listed there alongside its dependencies. Let me reiterate: this version of {ggplot2} is now unique to this project. You can work on other projects with other versions of {ggplot2} without interfering with this one. If for some reason you didn’t want to have the latest version of {ggplot2} installed in the project-specific library, you could have installed an older version, still thanks to {renv}. For example, to install an older version of {AER}:\n\nrenv::install(\"AER@1.0-0\") # this is a version from August 2008\n\nBut just like in the previous section, where we wanted to restore an old project that used {renv}, installation of older packages may fail. If you need to use old packages, there are approaches that work better, which we are also going to explore in this chapter.\nWhen you install more of the required packages for your project, you need to call renv::snapshot() to add the packages to the renv.lock file. Once you’re done with your project, call renv::snapshot() one last time to make sure that every dependency is correctly accounted for. Don’t forget to version the renv.lock file using Git!\n\n\n10.1.2 Collaborating with {renv}\n{renv} is also quite useful when collaborating. You can start the project and generate the lock file, and when your team-mates clone the repository from Github, they can get the exact same package versions as you. All of you only need to make sure that everyone is running the same R version to avoid any issues.\nThere is a vignette on just this that I invite you to read for more details, see here3.\n\n\n10.1.3 {renv}’s shortcomings\nAs useful as {renv} is, it also comes with some shortcomings (which I’ve already alluded to before). It is quite important to understand what {renv} does and what it doesn’t do, and why {renv} alone is not enough to ensure the long-term reproducibility of your projects.\nThe first problem, and I’m repeating myself here, is that {renv} only records the R version used for the project, but does not restore it when calling renv::restore(). You need to install the right R version yourself. On Windows this should be fairly easy to do, but then you need to start juggling R versions and know which scrips need which R version, which can get confusing.\nThere is the {rig} package that makes it easy to install and switch between R versions that you could check out4 if you’re interested. However, I don’t think that {rig} should be used for our purposes. I believe that it is safer to use Docker instead, and we shall see how to do so in the coming chapters.\nThe other issue of using {renv} is that future you, or your team-mates or people that want to reproduce your results need to install packages that may be quite difficult to install, either because they’re very old by now, or because their dependencies are difficult to satisfy. Have you ever tried to install a package that depended on {rJava}? Or the {rgdal} package? Installing these packages can be quite challenging, because they need specific system requirements that may be impossible for you to install (either because you don’t have admin rights on your workstation, or because the required version of these system dependencies is not available anymore). Having to install these packages (and potentially quite old versions at that) can really hinder the reproducibility of your project. Here again, Docker provides a solution. Future you, your team-mates or other people simply need to be able to run a Docker container, which is a much lower bar than installing these old libraries.\nNote also that during your journey, you will want to improve your scripts, you maybe will also want to upgrade some dependencies to take advantage of recent developments in some packages. This will require to upgrade the {renv} environment. But how will you be sure that these upgrades will not impair some other parts of your code? This is where we will speak about turning our analysis into a package and testing our code.\nI want to stress that this does not mean that {renv} is useless: we will keep using it, but together with Docker to ensure the reproducibility of our project. As I’ve written above already, at a minimum {renv} ensures that a project’s library doesn’t interfere with another project’s library and this is in itself already quite useful. The renv.lock file also provides a blueprint that can be used (by you or someone else) to build a Docker image for long-term reproducibility.\nLet’s now quickly discuss two other packages before finishing this chapter, which provide an answer to the question: how to rerun an old analysis if no renv.lock file was made available at the time the analysis was made?."

There might still be a solution (apart from running the script on the current version on R and packages, and hope that everything goes well), but for this you need to at least to know roughly when that script was written. Let’s say that you know that this script was written back in 2017, somewhere around October. If you know that, you can use the {rang} or {groundhog} packages to download the packages as of October 2018 in a separate library and then run your script.\n{rang} is fairly recent as of writing (February 2023) so I won’t go into too much detail now, as it is likely that the package will keep evolving rapidly in the coming weeks. So if you want to use it and follow its development, take a look at its Github repository here5 and read the prepint (Chan and Schoch (2023)).\n{groundhog} is another option that has been around for more time and is fairly easy to use. Suppose that you have a script from October 2018 that looks like this:\n\nlibrary(purrr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\ndata(mtcars)\n\nmyplot &lt;- ggplot(mtcars) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = hp, x = mpg))\n\nggsave(\"/home/project/output/myplot.pdf\", myplot)\n\nIf you want to run this script with the versions of {purrr} and {ggplot2} that were current in October 2017, you can achieve this by simply changing the library() calls:\n\ngroundhog::groundhog.library(\"\n    library(purrr)\n    library(ggplot2)\",\n    \"2017-10-04\"\n    )\n\ndata(mtcars)\n\nmyplot &lt;- ggplot(mtcars) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = hp, x = mpg))\n\nggsave(\"/home/project/output/myplot.pdf\", myplot)\n\nbut you will get the following message:\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n|IMPORTANT.\n|    Groundhog says: you are using R-4.2.2, but the version of R current\n|    for the entered date, '2017-10-04', is R-3.4.x. It is recommended\n|    that you either keep this date and switch to that version of R, or\n|    you keep the version of R you are using but switch the date to\n|    between '2022-04-22' and '2023-01-08'.\n|\n|    You may bypass this R-version check by adding:\n|    `tolerate.R.version='4.2.2'`as an option in your groundhog.library()\n|    call. Please type 'OK' to confirm you have read this message.\n|   &gt;ok\nGroundhog is speaking to us, advising us to switch to the version of R that was current at that time the script was written. If we want to ignore the message’s advice, and add tolerate.R.version = '4.2.2', we may get the script to run anyways:\n\ngroundhog.library(\"\n    library(purrr)\n    library(ggplot2)\",\n    \"2017-10-04\",\n    tolerate.R.version = \"4.2.2\")\n\ndata(mtcars)\n\nmyplot &lt;- ggplot(mtcars) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = hp, x = mpg))\n\nggsave(\"/home/project/output/myplot.pdf\", myplot)\n\nBut just like for {renv} (or {rang}), installation of the packages can fail, and for the same reasons (unmet system requirements most of the time).\nSo here again, the solution is to take care of the missing piece of the reproducibility puzzle, which is the whole computational environment itself."

This is because while the tools presented here are very useful, they will not be sufficient if we want our project to be truly reproducible, especially in the long-term. There are too many things that can go wrong when re-installing old package versions, so we must instead provide a way for users to not have to do it at all. This is where Docker is going to be helpful. But before that, we need to hit the development bench again. We are actually not quite done with our project; before going to full reproducibility, we should turn our analysis into a package. And as you will see, this is going to be much, much, easier than you might expect. You already did 95% of the job! There are many advantages to turning our analysis into a package, and not only from a reproducibility perspective.\n\n\n\n\nChan, Chung-hong, and David Schoch. 2023. “RANG: Reconstructing Reproducible r Computational Environments.” arXiv. https://doi.org/10.48550/ARXIV.2303.04758."

    "section": "11.1 Benefits of packages",
    "text": "11.1 Benefits of packages\nLet’s first go over the benefits of turning your analysis into a package once again, as this is crucial.\nThe main point is not to turn the analysis into a package to publish on CRAN (but you can if you want to). The point is that when you analyse data, you have to write a lot of custom code, and very often, you don’t expect to write that much custom code when starting. Let’s think about our little project: all we wanted was to create some plots from Luxembourguish houses’ price data. And yet, we had to scrape Wikipedia on two occasions, clean an Excel file, and write a test… the project is quite modest but the amount of code (and thus opportunities to make mistakes) is quite large. But, that’s not something that we could have anticipated, hence why we didn’t start the analysis by writing a package but a script (or an .Rmd) instead. But then as this script grows larger and larger, we realise that we might need something else than a simple .Rmd file and this is when we would start writing a package. Without {fusen}, we would almost need to start from scratch.\nThe other benefit of turning all this code into a package is that we get a clear separation between the code that we wrote purely to get our analysis going (what I called the software development part before) from the analysis itself (which would then typically consist in computing descriptive statistics, running regression or machine learning models, and visualisation). This then in turn means that we can more easily maintain and update each part separately. So the pure software development part goes into the package, which then gives us the possibility to use many great tools to ensure that our code is properly documented and tested, and then the analysis can go inside a purely reproducible pipeline. Putting the code into a package also makes it easier to re-use across projects."

    "text": "11.2 {fusen} quickstart\nIf you haven’t already, install the {fusen} package:\n\ninstall.packages(\"fusen\")\n\n{fusen} makes the documentation first method proposed by Sébastien Rochette, {fusen}’s author, simple to use. The idea is to start from documentation in the form of an .Rmd file and go from there to a package. Let’s dive right into it by starting from a template included in the {fusen} package. Start an R session from your home (or Documents) directory and run the following:\n\nfusen::create_fusen(path = \"fusen.quickstart\",\n                    template = \"minimal\")\n\nThis will create a directory called fusen.quickstart inside your home (or Documents) directory. Inside that folder, you will find another folder called dev/. Let’s see what’s inside it (I use the command line to list the files, but you’re free to use your file explorer program):\nowner@localhost ➤ ls dev/\n\n0-dev_history.Rmd  flat_minimal.Rmd\ndev/ contains two .Rmd files, 0-dev_history.Rmd and flat_miminal.Rmd. They’re both important, so let me explain what they do:\n\nflat_minimal.Rmd is only an example, a stand-in for our own .Rmd files. When doing actual work, we will be using the Rmd file(s) that we have written before (analyse_data.Rmd and save_data.Rmd) instead, or if this is a fresh project, we could rename flat_minimal.Rmd and use it a template for our analysis.\n0-dev_history.Rmd contains lines of code that you typically run when you’re developing a package. For example, a line to initialise Git for the project, a line to add some dependencies, etc. The idea is to write down everything that you type in the console in this file. This leaves a trace of what you have been doing, and also acts as a checklist so that you can make sure that you didn’t forget anything. You can also re-use for any other package development project.\n\nBefore describing these files in detail, I want to show you this image taken from {fusen}’s website1:\n\n\n\n{fusen} takes care of the boring stuff for you!\n\n\nOn the left-hand side of the image, we see the two template .Rmd files from {fusen}. 0-dev_history.Rmd contains a chunk called description. This is the main chunk in that file that we need to execute to get started with {fusen}. Running this chunk will create the package’s DESCRIPTION file (don’t worry if you don’t know about this file yet, I will explain). Then, the second file flat_minimal.Rmd (or our very own .Rmd files) contains functions, tests, examples, and everything we need for our analysis. When we inflate the Rmd file, {fusen} places every piece from this .Rmd file in the right place: the functions get copied into the package’s R/ folder, tests go into the tests/ folder, and so on. {fusen} simply takes care of everything for us!\nBut for {fusen} to be able to work its magic, we do need to prepare our .Rmd files a bit. But don’t worry, it is mostly simply giving adequate names to our code chunks. Let’s take a look at the flat_minimal.Rmd file that was just generated. If you open it in a text editor, you should see that it is a fairly normal .Rmd file. There is a comment telling you to first run the description chunk in the 0-dev_history.Rmd file before changing this one. But let’s keep reading flat_minimal.Rmd. What’s important comes next:\n# my_fun\n\n```{r function-my_fun}\n#' my_fun Title\n#'\n#' @return 1\n#' @export\n#'\n#' @examples\nmy_fun &lt;- function() {\n  1\n}\n```\n\n```{r examples-my_fun}\nmy_fun()\n```\n\n```{r tests-my_fun}\ntest_that(\"my_fun works\", {\n\n})\n```\nThis is a section titled my_fun. Then comes the definition of my_fun(), inside a chunk titled function-my_fun, then comes an example, inside a chunk titled examples-my_fun and finally a test in a chunk titled tests-my_fun.\nThis is essentially how we need to rewrite our own .Rmd files to be able to use {fusen}, and what’s really nice is that this is essentially what we did before, but with some added structure on it. Using {fusen} just forces us to clean up our code and define examples and tests (if we want them) more cleanly and explicitly. Also, you might have noticed that in the chunk with the function definition there are a bunch of comments that start with #'. These are {roxygen2} type comments. As the package’s documentation gets built, these comments get automatically turned into the documentation you see when you type help(\"my_fun\") in an R console. So even the comments that you typically write to explain how your code works can be re-used to build documentation that will be much easier to browse than comments in source code!\nSo, basically, a {fusen}-ready .Rmd file is nothing more than an .Rmd file with some structure imposed on it. Instead of documenting your functions as simple comments, document them using {roxygen2} comments, which then get turned into the package’s documentation automatically. Instead of trying your function out on some mock data in your console, write down that example inside the .Rmd file itself. Instead of writing ad-hoc tests, or worse, instead of testing your functions on your console manually, one by one (and we’ve all done this), write down the test inside the .Rmd file itself, right next to the function you’re testing.\nWrite it down, write it down, write it down… you’re already documenting and testing things (most of the time in the console only), so why not just write it down once and for all, so you don’t have to rely on your ageing, mushy brain so much? Don’t make yourself remember things, just write them down! {fusen} gives you a perfect framework to do this. The added benefit is that it will improve your package’s quality through the tests and examples that are not directly part of the analysis itself but are still required to make sure that the analysis is of high quality, reproducible and maintainable. So that if you start messing with your functions, you have the tests right there to tell you if you introduced breaking changes.\nLet’s go back to the template and inflate it into a package. Open 0-dev_history.Rmd and take a look at the description code chunk:\n```{r description, eval=FALSE}\n# Describe your package\nfusen::fill_description(\n  pkg = here::here(),\n  fields = list(\n    Title = \"Build A Package From Rmarkdown File\",\n    Description = \"Use Rmarkdown First method to build your package.\n                   Start your package with documentation.\n                   Everything can be set from a Rmarkdown file\n                   in your project.\",\n    `Authors@R` = c(\n      person(\"Sebastien\", \"Rochette\", email = \"sebastien@thinkr.fr\",\n             role = c(\"aut\", \"cre\"),\n             comment = c(ORCID = \"0000-0002-1565-9313\")),\n      person(given = \"ThinkR\", role = \"cph\")\n    )\n  )\n)\n# Define License with use_*_license()\nusethis::use_mit_license(\"Sébastien Rochette\")\n```\nThe fill_description() function will create the package’s DESCRIPTION file. Here2 is an example of such a file. This file provides some information on who wrote the package, the purpose of the package, as well as some metadata such as the package’s version. While developing your package, you will continuously fill some important extra parts of this file, such that parts that list dependencies required to be able to use your package: Depends:, Imports: and Suggests:. Depends: is where you list packages (or R versions) that must be installed for your package to work (if they’re not installed, they will be installed alongside your package). This is the same with Imports:, and the difference with Depends: is most of the time irrelevant: packages listed under Depends: will not only be loaded when you load your package, but also attached. This means that the functions from these packages will also be available to the end-user when loading your package. Most of the time, you do not have to list packages under Depends:. Packages listed under Imports: will only be loaded, meaning that their functions will only be available to your packages’ functions, not the end-users themselves. If that’s confusing, don’t worry too much about it, this will not be consequential for our purposes. Finally, Suggests: are dependencies that are not critical for your package to run, usually these are only necessary if you want to run the code from the package’s vignettes or examples. As you can imagine, listing the right packages under the right category can be a daunting task. But don’t worry, {fusen} takes care of this automatically for us! Simply focus on writing your .Rmd files.\nThe last line of this chunk runs usethis::use_mit_license(). {usethis} is a package that contains many helper functions to help you develop packages. You can choose among many licenses. Note that any open-source work should present a license, so that users know how they are allowed to use it. Otherwise, theoretically, without license, no one is allowed to re-use or share your work. You don’t need to think too much about it at the start, since you can always change the license later. And if you don’t want to publish your package anywhere (nor CRAN, nor Github) and keep it completely internal to your organisation, you can just define a proprietary license with usethis::use_proprietary_license(\"your name\"). My very personal take on licenses is that you should use copyleft licenses as much as possible (so licenses like the GPL) which ensure that if others take your code and change it, their changes also have to be republished to the public under the GPL – but only if they wish to publish their changes at all. They could always keep their modifications totally private, which means that companies can, and do, use GPL’ed code in their internal products.\nIt’s when that product gets released to the public that the source code must be released as well. This ensures that open code stays open.\nHowever, licenses like the MIT allow private companies to take open source and freely available code and incorporate it inside their own proprietary tools, without having to give back their modifications to the community. Some people argue that this is the true free license, because anyone is then also free to use any code and they also have the liberty of not having to give anything back to the community. I think that this is a very idiotic argument, and when proponents of permissive licenses like the MIT (or BSD) get their code taken and not even thanked for it (as per the license, which doesn’t even force anyone to cite the software), and their software gets used for nefarious purposes, the levels of cope are through the roof3 (archived link for posterity). Anyway, I got side-tracked here, let’s go back to our package.\nRun the code of the two functions inside the description chunk in an R console (don’t change anything for now, and make sure that the R session was started on the root of the project, so in the fusen.quickstart/ folder), and see the DESCRIPTION file appear magically in the root of the folder (as well as the LICENSE file, containing the license).\nFor now, we can ignore the rest of the 0-dev_history.Rmd file: actually, everything that follows the description code chunk is totally optional, but still useful. If you look at them, you see that the lines that follow simply help you remember to do useful things, like initialising Git, creating a Readme file, add some usual dependencies, and so on. But let’s ignore this for now, and go to the flat_minimal.Rmd file.\nGo at the end of the file, and take a look at the chunk titled development-inflate. This is the chunk that will convert the .Rmd file into a fully functioning package. This process is called inflating the .Rmd file (because a fusen is a type of origami figure that you fold in a certain way, which can then get literally inflated into a box). Run the code in that chunk, and see your analysis become a package automagically.\nIf you look now at the projects’ folder, you will see several new sub-folder:\n\nR/: the folder that contains the functions;\nman/: contains the functions’ documentation;\ntests/: contains the tests;\nvignettes/: contains the vignettes.\n\nEvery function defined in the flat_minimal.Rmd file is now inside the R/ folder; all the documentation written as {roxygen2} comments is now neatly inside man/, the tests are in tests/, and flat_minimal.Rmd has been converted to an actual vignette (without all the development chunks). This is now a package that can be installed immediately using devtools::install(), or that can be shared on Github and installed from there. Right now, without doing anything else. You can even generate a website for your package: got back to the 0-dev_history.Rmd and check the last code chunk, under the title Share the package. Start a new, fresh session at the root of your project and run the two following lines from that last chunk:\n\n# set and try pkgdown documentation website\nusethis::use_pkgdown()\npkgdown::build_site()\n\nThis will build a website for your package using the {pkgdown} website and open your web browser and show you how it looks like. The files for this website are in the newly created docs/ folder in the root of your package folder. This can then be hosted, for free, with a service from Github called Github Pages so people can explore the package’s functions and documentation without having to install the package! Later in this chapter, I will show you how to do this."

    "text": "11.3 Turning our Rmds into a package\nOk, so I hope to have convinced you that {fusen} is definitely something that you should add to your toolbox. Let’s now turn our analysis into a package, but before diving right into it, let’s think about it for a moment.\nWe have two .Rmd files, one for getting and cleaning the data, which we called save_data.Rmd and another for analysing this data, called analyse_data.Rmd.\nIn both .Rmd files, we defined a bunch of functions, but most of the functions were defined in the save_data.Rmd script. In fact, in the analyse_data.Rmd file we defined only two functions, get_laspeyeres(), the function to get the Laspeyeres price index, and make_plot(), the function to create the plots for our analysis.\nWe are faced with the following choice here:\n\nmake both these .Rmd files fusen-ready, and inflate them both. This would put the functions from both save_data.Rmd and analyse_data.Rmd into the inflated package R/ folder;\nput all the functions into save_data.Rmd and only inflate that file. The other, analyse_data.Rmd can then be used exclusively for the analysis stricto sensu.\n\nThis is really up to you, there is no right or wrong answer. You could even go for another option if you wanted. It all depends on how much time you want to invest into this. If you want to get done quickly, the first option, where you simply inflate both files is the fastest. If you have more time, the last option, where you neatly split everything might be better. I propose that we go for the second option. This way, we only have to inflate one file, and in our case here, it won’t take much time anyways. It’s literally only moving two code chunks from analyse_data.Rmd to save_data.Rmd. So before continuing, let’s go back to our repository and switch back to the rmd branch that contains the .Rmd files (let’s ignore freezing packages with {renv} and thus the renv branch for now):\nowner@localhost ➤ git checkout rmd\nUsing the rmd branch as a starting point, let’s create a new branch called fusen:\nowner@localhost ➤ git checkout -b fusen\nSwitched to a new branch 'fusen'\nWe will now be working on this branch. Simply work as usual, but when pushing, make sure to push to the fusen branch:\nowner@localhost ➤ git add .\nowner@localhost ➤ git commit -m \"some changes\"\nowner@localhost ➤ git push origin fusen\nBy now, that repository should have four branches:\n\nmaster, or main with the simple .R scripts;\nrmd, with the .Rmd files\nrenv, containing the .Rmd files as well, and the renv.lock file\nfusen, the branch we will be using now.\n\nIf you’ve skipped the first part of the book, or didn’t diligently create the branches and push, you can fork this repository4 and then clone it to start from a sane base. Switch to the rmd branch, and create a branch called fusen.\nFirst order of business: create a {fusen} flat template in a dev/ folder. Start a fresh R session inside the housing/ folder, and run the following:\n\nfusen::create_fusen(path = \".\",\n                    template = \"minimal\",\n                    overwrite = TRUE)\n\nBecause we already have a folder for our project, called housing/ we use \".\" which essentially means “right here”. We need the overwrite = TRUE option because the folder exists already. Running the above command will add the dev/ folder. Move save_data.Rmd inside dev/; remember, we only want to inflate that one: analyse_data.Rmd will be a simple .Rmd that will use our package to load the needed functions and data.\nNext step, move the functions get_laspeyeres() and make_plot() from analyse_data.Rmd to save_data.Rmd. Simple cut and paste these functions from one .Rmd to the other. Make sure save_data.Rmd looks something like this5, take a look at the end of the script to find the functions we’ve moved over. The analyse_data.Rmd script is exactly the same, minus the functions that we’ve just moved over.\nOk, so now, we need to make save_data.Rmd ready to be inflated. Take inspiration from the flat_minimal.Rmd that fusen::create_fusen() put in the dev/ folder. This is what the end-result should look like6 (no worries, I’m going to explain how I got there). For consistency with your future use of {fusen}, you could also rename the save_data.Rmd to flat_save_data.Rmd, although this won’t avoid {fusen} to work properly.\nLet’s start by the first function, get_raw_data(). If you compare the before7 and after8, the differences are that we have named the chunk containing the function, function-get_raw_data and added documentation in the form of {roxygen2} comments. Naming the chunks is essential: this is how {fusen} knows that this chunk contains a function that should go into the R/ folder. {roxygen2} comments are strictly speaking not required, but it is highly advised that you add them: this way, your function will get documented and users (including future you) will be able to read the documentation by typing help(get_raw_data). And you’re likely already adding comments explaining what the function does anyway. Another difference is that I have made all the functions referentially transparent. Take a closer look at make_plot() in the before and after .Rmd’s. You will see that I’ve added two arguments to make_plot(), country_level_data and commune_level_data. This is really important, so don’t forget to do it!\nRemember when I mentioned that the good thing about turning our analysis into a package is that it gives us a framework to develop high quality code by using nice development tools? {roxygen2} type comments for documentation is the first such tool in this list. By commenting your functions, you explain what the inputs are, what the outputs are going to be, and also how to use the functions with some examples. Using {fusen} (and {roxygen2}), you simply continue doing the same, but with some added structure. This added structure is not costly to impose on yourself, and comes with many added benefits (in this case, free documentation!). I’m repeating myself but I really want to drive this point home: the goal is not to have to add code on top of what you already did. The point is to do what you always do, but within a framework.\nLet’s now look at the functions’ {roxygen2}-type comments. The first line:\n#' get_raw_data Gets raw nominal house price data from LU Open Data Portal\nwill create the title of the function’s help page. Then come the @param lines (in this case we only have one):\n#' @param url Optional: Persistent url to the data\nThis lists the parameters of the function. Here you can explain exactly what the inputs should be. What happens if the function you’re documenting has several parameters and you forget to document one? If that happens, when you will inflate the file, you will get a warning in the console that will look like this:\ninflate warnings and errors: Undocumented arguments in documentation \nobject 'get_raw_data'\n  'url'\nThen come the @importFrom statements. This is where you list dependencies:\n#' @importFrom readxl excel_sheets read_excel\n#' @importFrom utils download.file\n#' @importFrom dplyr mutate rename select\n#' @importFrom stringr str_trim\n#' @importFrom janitor clean_names\n#' @importFrom purrr map_dfr\nThis is important, because the statements will write the dependencies into the package’s NAMESPACE file. This file is important, because any function defined there will be available to your package’s functions when you load the package. So if your function use dplyr::mutate() for example, your package needs to know where to look for mutate(). This is where the NAMESPACE file comes into play. Take the opportunity to list the dependencies of your function to review them: maybe you’re using a package for a single dependency that you could easily remove. For example, I’m using stringr::str_trim() to remove whitespace around characters. But I could be using the base R function trimws() instead, which would remove this dependency. I’m going to keep it here, because I’m lazy though. It might seem like extra work to add these statements. But you have to see it this way: you are writing the functions here, once, that need to be available to your functions for them to work. The alternative is to have to write:\n\nlibrary(\"readxl\")\nlibrary(\"utils\")\nlibrary(\"dplyr\")\nlibrary(\"stringr\")\nlibrary(\"janitor\")\nlibrary(\"purrr\")\n\non top of each script that uses your functions. This gets old pretty fast and is error prone. By declaring the dependencies here, you ensure that they get recorded by {renv} and will make using your project much easier.\nYou will also notice the following importFrom statement:\n#' @importFrom utils download.file\ndownload.file() is included in the {utils} package, itself included with a base installation of R. So you don’t really need to specify it; but when inflating the file, you get the following message:\nConsider adding\n  importFrom(\"utils\", \"download.file\")\nto your NAMESPACE file.\nhence why I’ve added it, to silence this message. Again, not mandatory, but why not do it?\nNow comes the @return keyword: this simply tells your users what the function returns. If the function doesn’t return anything, because it only has a side effect (for example, writing something to disk, or printing something on screen), then you could return NULL.\n#' @return A data frame\nLast but not least, the @export keyword:\n#' @export\nThis makes the function available to users that load the package using library(housing). If you don’t add this keyword, the function will be only available to the other functions of the package. Another way to see this: functions decorated with the @export keyword are public, functions without it are private. But the concept of private functions doesn’t really exist in R. You can always access a “private” function by using ::: (three times the :), as in package:::private_function().\nThe other functions are documented in the same manner, so I won’t comment them here. Something else you might have noticed: I replaced every %&gt;% by the base pipe |&gt;. You don’t have to do it, but the advantage of using the base pipe is that it removes the dependency on the {magrittr} package, needed for %&gt;%. If you want to use %&gt;%, you can keep it, but then should run the line:\n\nusethis::use_pipe()\n\nin the 0-dev_history.Rmd file, which will take care of adding this dependency correctly for you (by editing the NAMESPACE file).\nNext comes the test we wrote. As a reminder, here is how it looked like in our original .Rmd file:\nLet’s test to see if all the communes from our dataset are represented.\n\n```{r}\nsetdiff(flat_data$locality, communes)\n```\nThe objects communes and flat_data have to obviously exist for this test to pass. This was a very simple test that must be monitored interactively. If commune names are returned here, then this means that there are communes left that we need to include in our data. But remember: we are aiming at building a RAP, and don’t want to have to look at it as it is running to see if everything is alright. What we need is a test that returns an error if it fails and which should completely halt the pipeline. So for this we use the {testthat} package, and write a so-called unit test. We’re going to deep-dive into unit testing (and assertive testing) in the next chapter, so for now, let me simply comment the test:\n```{r tests-clean_flat_data}\n# We now need to check if we have them all in the data.\n# The test needs to be self-contained, hence\n# why we need to redefine the required variables:\n\nformer_communes &lt;- get_former_communes()\n\ncurrent_communes &lt;- get_current_communes()\n\ncommunes &lt;- get_test_communes(\n  former_communes,\n  current_communes\n)\n\nraw_data &lt;- get_raw_data(url = \"https://is.gd/1vvBAc\")\n\nflat_data &lt;- clean_raw_data(raw_data)\n\ntestthat::expect_true(\n  all(communes %in% unique(flat_data$locality))\n)\n```\nThe first thing that you need to know is that tests need to be self-contained. This is why we define former_communes and current_communes again. The reason is that {fusen} will take this whole chunk and save it inside a script in the package’s tests/ folder. When executed, the test will run in a fresh session where the communes object is not defined. So that’s why you need to redefine every variable the test needs to run. For the test itself, we use testthat::expect_true(). This function expects a piece of code that should evaluate to TRUE: if not, we get an error, and the whole pipeline stops here, forcing us to see what’s going on. This is exactly what we want: when our code fails, it needs to fail as early and as spectacularly as possible. If you rely on future you to have to manually check console output or logs and look for errors, you deserve everything that’s going to happen to you.\nUnder the section titled “Functions used for analysis”, I copy-and-pasted the functions from the analyse_data.Rmd and documented them as well. What’s new is that I’ve added examples:\n```{r examples-get_laspeyeres, eval = FALSE}\n#' \\dontrun{\n#' commune_level_data_laspeyeres &lt;- get_laspeyeres(commune_level_data)\n#' }\n```\nBut I don’t want these examples to run, I just want them to simply appear in the documentation. This is because, just like for tests, examples have to be self-contained. So for this example to run successfully, I would need to redefine commune_level_data from scratch. I don’t want to do this now, so hence why I wrapped the example around \\dontrun and used roxygen-style comments with #'. I did the same with the function to plot the data.\nWe’re almost done; take a look again at the template flat_minimal.Rmd. I advised you to take inspiration from it to get save_data.Rmd fusen-ready. At the end of that file, we can see this chunk:\n```{r development-inflate, eval=FALSE}\n# Run but keep eval=FALSE to avoid infinite loop\n# Execute in the console directly\nfusen::inflate(flat_file = \"dev/flat_minimal.Rmd\",\n               vignette_name = \"Minimal\")\n```\nThis chunk contains the code that we need to run, manually, to inflate the package. However, I’ve removed it from my save_data.Rmd file, and the reason is that I prefer to have it inside the 0-dev_history.Rmd file. I think that it makes more sense to have it there. Take a look at my 0-dev_history.Rmd here9. By reading that file, you see all the different developer actions that were taken. Your team-mates, or future you could read this, and immediately understand what happened, and what was done. Under the section title “Inflate save_data.Rmd”, you see that the chunk to inflate the .Rmd file and generate the package is there. I can run this chunk from 0-dev_history.Rmd and have my package successfully generated. Something important to notice as well: my fusen-ready .Rmd file is simply called save_data.Rmd, while the generated, inflated file, that will be part of the package under the vignettes/ folder is called dev-save_data.Rmd.\nWhen you inflate you flat file into a package, the R console will be verbose. This lists all files that are created or modified, but there is also a long list of checks that run automatically. This is the output of devtools::check() that is included inside fusen::inflate(). This function verifies that your package, once inflated, follows the rules of package development. It is likely that this will result in some fails, warnings and notes. Your goal is to make it to 0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 notes. This will be a tricky part while developing packages, as you may not understand all outputs the first times. However, if you read the long list carefully, you will see that you are helped in many ways: position of the problems, type of problem, … Fix the problems in the flat file, and inflate again, until the number of errors is null. We will not get deeper into it in this book, you may want to search for check() in https://r-pkgs.org to go further.\nI suggest that you stop here, and really try to get this working as well. You can start by simply cloning this repository10 I linked in the beginning of this chapter, and follow along. After inflating, take a look at the vignette generated from the inflated dev-save_data.Rmd, which you can find under the vignettes/ folder. One thing you need to understand is that the save_data.Rmd file that you inflate, under dev/, is a working file for developers. The generated vignette on the other hand, can be read by stakeholders other than developers as well. In my case, I’ve added the prefix dev- because this vignette deals with preparing data for including in the package, and there is not much point for a stakeholder other than a developer to read this vignette. You will notice that the generated vignette does not contain the function chunks. This is normal, because after inflating the .Rmd file, the functions get saved under the R/ folder. Really take some time to understand this. Because what follows will assume that you have groked {fusen}."

    "text": "11.4 Including datasets\nAnother difference between our initial .Rmd and the fusen-ready .Rmd, is that the fusen-ready save_data.Rmd file does not save the datasets as .csv files anymore. This is because it is much better to include them directly in the package, and make them available to users by running the line:\n\ndata(\"commune_level_data\")\n\nTo include data to a package, we need the package to already be built; only once the package exists can we include data sets. This is why we need to inflate save_data.Rmd first. So, how do we include data sets in a package? If you are developing packages in the usual manner (meaning, without {fusen}) then you have to do the following steps:\n\nwrite a script that generates the data set (and save this script inside the data-raw/ folder for future reference)\nsave the datasets inside the data/ folder.\n\nBut we are using {fusen}, so instead, we can use the documentation first approach! And actually, the first step is done already: we have our vignette save_data.Rmd! Let’s not forget that the whole point of save_data.Rmd file was, initially, to build these datasets and save them. So why not simply re-use this vignette? If you take a look at the inflated dev-save_data.Rmd, you will see that everything is right there! That’s obvious, because that was the Rmd file that we used to build the datasets in the first place. So remember, we don’t want to have to repeat ourselves. The vignette is right there with the code we need, so we are going to use it.\nIf you look at 0-dev_history.Rmd, everything is explained under the header “Including datasets”. The idea is to run the code inside the vignette, which creates our datasets, and then save these datasets in the right place using usethis::use_data(), mimicking the steps from “traditional” package development. In my 0-dev_history.Rmd here11, I wrapped all the code around the local() function to run all these steps inside a temporary, local environment. This way, any variable that gets made by knitting the vignette gets discarded once we’re done saving the datasets. You may need to install your package before, using remotes::install_local().\nFinally, we need to document the datasets. For this, we use another .Rmd file that we inflate as well. You can find it under dev/data_doc.Rmd, or by clicking here12. Datasets get defined inside chunks, just like functions, using {roxygen2}-type comments.\nThis basically covers what you need to know to package code. Of course, there are many other topics that we could discuss, but for our purposes, this is enough. We now know how to take advantage of the tools that make package development easy, and have diverted them for our use. If you want to develop a proper package and push it to CRAN, then I highly recommend you read the second edition of R packages13 by Wickham and Bryan (2023). This book goes into all the nitty gritty details of full package development. But let me be clear: this does not mean that you cannot develop a full, CRAN-ready, package using {fusen}. You absolutely can! It’s just that this is outside the scope of the present book."

    "text": "11.5 Installing and sharing the package\nTo install the package on the same machine that you developed it, you can simply run the line remotes::install_local() on line 46 of the 0-dev_history.Rmd file (ideally in a fresh R session). But how can you share it with colleagues or future you?\nNow that the package is ready, you need to be able to share it. This really depends on whether you can publish the code on Github or not, or whether your company/institution has a self-hosted version control system. In this section, we’re going to explore the following two scenarios: the package is hosted on Github (or in a private self-hosted version control system), or the package cannot be hosted for whatever reason but you still need to share the package.\n\n11.5.1 Code is hosted\nSo if the code is hosted on Github (or on a self-hosted, private, version control system), users of the package can install it directly from Github. This can be done using the {remotes} package, like this:\n\nremotes::install_github(\"github_username/repository_name\")\n\nIt is also possible to install the package from a specific branch:\n\nremotes::install_github(\"github_username/repository_name@repo_name\")\n\nit is even possible to install the package exactly how it was at a specific commit:\n\nremotes::install_github(\"github_username/repository_name@repo_name\",\n                        ref = \"commit_hash\")\n\nFor example, if you want to install the package we have developed together from my Github account, you could run the following (the commit hash is actually wrong so you don’t install this one by mistake):\n\nremotes::install_github(\"rap4all/housing@fusen\",\n                        ref = \"ae42601\")\n\nSo the package in the fusen branch and at commit “ae42601” gets installed. Keep in mind that you can specify the commit hash to install the exact version you need, because this is going to do wonders for reproducibility.\n\n\n11.5.2 Code cannot be hosted\nIf the code cannot be hosted, then you have to share it manually. That’s less than ideal, but sometimes there simply is no alternative. In that case, you need to prepare a compressed archive that you can share. This is easily done using devtools::build(). Start a new session in the root directory of you package, and run devtools::build(). This will create a .tar.gz file that you can send to you team-mates, or archive for future you. Ideally, before creating this file, you should go to 0-dev_history.Rmd and update the version number in the fusen::fill_description() function, like so:\n\nfusen::fill_description(\n  pkg = here::here(),\n  fields = list(\n    Title = \"Housing Data For Luxembourg\",\n    Version = \"0.1\", # notice that I’ve added a version number here\n    Description = \"This package contains functions to get,\n                   clean and analyse housing price data for Luxembourg.\",\n    `Authors@R` = c(\n      person(\"Bruno\", \"Rodrigues\", email = \"bruno@brodrigues.co\",\n             role = c(\"aut\", \"cre\"),\n             comment = c(ORCID = \"0000-0002-3211-3689\"))\n    )\n  )\n, overwrite = TRUE) # you need to add overwrite = TRUE to overwrite the file\n\nYou have to be very disciplined here, because you have to make sure that you keep updating this and documenting which version of the package should get used for which project. Also, make sure that you can store generated .tar.gz alongside the project and that you provide clear installation instructions. To install a package from a .tar.gz file, open a new R session and run the following:\nremotes::install_local(\"path/to/package/housing_0.0.0.9000.tar.gz\")\n\n\n11.5.3 Marketing your work\nOnce your package is done, whether it is destined for CRAN or not, whether it can only be shared within your organisation or not, it is important to market it and make it discoverable. This is where building a website for the package is important, and thankfully, it but takes two lines of code to build a fully functioning site. In the introduction we built the website for the template included with {fusen}, let’s now build a website for our housing package.\nThis website can then be hosted online if you wish, or it can be shared internally to your organisation, offline, as a means of providing documentation.\nTake a look at the very last section of the 0-dev_history.Rmd file, titled “Share the package”. If you execute the lines in that chunk (ideally from a fresh R session), a website will be built automatically. You can find the website’s files in the docs/ folder: open the index.html file using a web-browser and you can start navigating the documentation!\nIf your package is on Github, you can also host the website for free on Github pages. For this, you can build the website locally and send it to GitHub, or use GitHub Actions to build and publish it automatically.\nFor the manual build, first make sure that the .gitignore file in the root of your package does not contain the docs/ folder. If it does, remove it. Then, commit and push. This will upload the docs/ package on Github. Then, go to the repository’s settings, and “Pages” and then choose the branch that contains the docs/ folder:\n\n\n\nChoose these options to host your package’s website for free!\n\n\nFor the automatic build, first make sure that the .gitignore file in the root of your package does contain the docs/ folder, so that you do not send your local verifications. Then go to your 0-dev_history.Rmd to run:\nusethis::use_github_action(\"pkgdown\")\nCommit the .github/ directory with its yml files and push. GitHub Action is a service that automatically runs following instructions in the yml file, at each commit. When you commit in the main or master branch, the website will be built. As above, in the GitHub settings, you will need to define the root of the gh-pages branch to be published as GitHub Pages. This is called Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. Note that you may want to set the other GitHub Actions listed in the 0-dev_history.Rmd to make it check your package on a different computer than yours. There is a chapter about CI/CD later in this book.\nAs an example of the website, you can visit the website of the package we’ve built together here14.\nThe package’s README will be shown, if available, on the starting page of the website. So if you want to add a README to your package, go to the 0-dev_history.Rmd file and execute the line usethis::use_readme_rmd(), which adds a template README file in the root of your package. Regardless of whether you want to build a website, adding a README to it is always a good idea! You could explain what the main features of the package are, and how to install it, especially if you want your users or future you to install the package at a certain commit, it is quite useful to write it down clearly in the instructions. Something like:\nTo install this package, run the following lines of code:\n\n```\n\nremotes::install_github(\"rap4all/housing@fusen\",\n                        ref = \"ae42601\")\n```\nYou can also include the link to your website documentation."

We can now more easily document the code, define its dependencies, and also share it with teammates, our future selves or the world. What’s more, we clearly separate two tasks from each other: the pure software engineering part, which consisted in building the package, from the pure data analysis part, which will eventually become our pipeline.\nBut turning the analysis into a package is optional; this is not something that you absolutely have to do in order to turn your analysis reproducible. However, the entry cost of package development is really lowered thanks to {fusen} and the benefits are really great, so I think that is important to do.\nThere is one chapter left before we actually build a full-fledged pipeline. In the next chapter, we will learn how to use unit and assertive testing to further improve the code of our package, which will thus also improve the quality of our analysis.\n\n\n\n\nWickham, Hadley, and Jenny Bryan. 2023.

    "section": "12.1 Unit testing",
    "text": "12.1 Unit testing\nUnit testing is the testing of units. What’s a unit? Functions are units! We actually already encountered one unit test before, in the save_data.Rmd script:\n\n```{r tests-clean_flat_data}\n# We now need to check if we have them all in the data.\n# The test needs to be self-contained, hence\n# why we need to redefine the required variables:\n\nformer_communes &lt;- get_former_communes()\n\ncurrent_communes &lt;- get_current_communes()\n\ncommunes &lt;- get_test_communes(\n  former_communes,\n  current_communes\n)\n\nraw_data &lt;- get_raw_data(url = \"https://is.gd/1vvBAc\")\n\nflat_data &lt;- clean_raw_data(raw_data)\n\ntestthat::expect_true(\n            all(communes %in% unique(flat_data$locality))\n                      )\n```\nWhen using {fusen}, a unit test should be a self-contained chunk that can be executed completely independently. This is why in this chunk we re-created the different variables that were needed, communes and flat_data. If you were developing the package without {fusen}, you would need to do the same, so don’t think that this is somehow a limitation of {fusen}.\nThe test above ensures that we find all the former and current communes of Luxembourg in our dataset. Let me explain again why we want to write such a test down in a script and not simply try it out in our console “manually” to check if the code works.\nFor this test to pass, a lot of moving pieces have to fall together. If anything changes, be it because you changed something in either get_raw_data() or clean_raw_data() or because something changed with the Wikipedia tables you scraped, this test will not pass. And you should be made aware of failures as soon as possible! Also, this test ensures that when the data gets updated, you are certain that if you use the code in save_data.Rmd you will get a new dataset that is likely correct, even if new communes merge. And mergers will happen around 2024 by the way, the communes of Groussbous and Wal will merge, and the communes of Bous and Waldbredimus as well. So you need to make sure that when this happens, your code knows how to handle this, or at least returns an error as early as possible.\nIdeally, you need to test every function that you wrote, but sometimes that’s not really possible, either due to lack of time, or because the function is quite trivial, so maybe no test is warranted. But be careful what you consider trivial though, I have personally been bitten in the past by “trivially” simple functions! For example, a function like this one:\n```{r function-make_commune_level_data}\n#' make_commune_level_data Makes the final data at commune level\n#'\n#' @param flat_data Flat data df as returned by clean_flat_data()\n#' @importFrom dplyr filter\n#' @return A data frame\n#' @export\nmake_commune_level_data &lt;- function(flat_data){\n  flat_data |&gt;\n    filter(!grepl(\"nationale|offres\", locality),\n           !is.na(locality))\n}\n\n```\nmight not need to be unit-tested. An assertion, which we will learn about in the next section, is likely better suited to the above function. However, as functions become more complex, unit tests are highly recommended. This is because it can become very difficult to make sure that changing some part of the function somewhere does not affect some other part. This is where writing several unit tests can be useful. As long as all unit tests keep succeeding (or passing) you are somewhat sure that what you’re doing is not breaking stuff. And unit tests are especially useful when collaborating using trunk-based development! As the project leader, you could for example refuse to merge changes that break unit tests.\nBefore continuing, let’s rewrite the test we have already. While it is fully working, I didn’t really write it in the canonical form. Inside dev/save_data.Rmd, change the code of the test to the following:\n```{r tests-clean_flat_data}\n# We now need to check if we have them all in the data.\n# The test needs to be self-contained, hence\n# why we need to redefine the required variables:\n\nformer_communes &lt;- get_former_communes()\n\ncurrent_communes &lt;- get_current_communes()\n\ncommunes &lt;- get_test_communes(\n  former_communes,\n  current_communes\n)\n\nraw_data &lt;- get_raw_data(url = \"https://is.gd/1vvBAc\")\n\nflat_data &lt;- clean_raw_data(raw_data)\n\ntest_that(\"Check if all communes are accounted for\", {\n\n  expect_true(\n    all(communes %in% unique(flat_data$locality))\n  )\n\n})\n```\nThe only difference is that instead of calling testthat::expect_true() directly, I wrapped this call inside testthat::test_that(). This way, I can add a description to the test. This is useful if the test fails.\nSave dev/save_data.Rmd and go back to 0-dev_history.Rmd to inflate save_data.Rmd again. Everything should work without problems.\nIf the test fails, you get an informative message. To illustrate, I’ve added a typo in the test and inflated save_data.Rmd. Because tests always run when a fusen-package gets inflated, this test failed and here is the output:\n══ Failed tests ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n── Error ('test-get_raw_data.R:18'): Check if all communes are accounted for ───\nError in `communs %in% unique(flat_data$locality)`: object 'communs' not found\nBacktrace:\n    ▆\n 1. ├─testthat::expect_true(all(communs %in% unique(flat_data$locality))) \n    at test-get_raw_data.R:18:2\n 2. │ └─testthat::quasi_label(enquo(object), label, arg = \"object\")\n 3. │   └─rlang::eval_bare(expr, quo_get_env(quo))\n 4. └─communs %in% unique(flat_data$locality)\n\n[ FAIL 1 | WARN 2 | SKIP 0 | PASS 0 ]\nError: Test failures\nExecution halted\nThe file test-get_raw_data.R contains our test, generated by inflating save_data.Rmd. You can find it under the tests/testthat/ folder of your inflated package. You can also see the description that we’ve added, which helps us find the test that failed. In cases like this, you should go back to the function that makes the test fail and correct it, until the test passes. You should also make sure that everything is alright with the test itself. If there really is a typo in the test, you should of course correct the test (in dev/save_data.Rmd, not in tests/testthat/)!\nNow, let’s add a unit test to another function, get_laspeyeres(). This function seems to me like a good candidate for testing, as it is not that trivial.\nLet’s try with something simple. get_laspeyeres() expects either commune_level_data or country_level_data. What happens if we provide another dataset? The function very likely returns an error. So let’s test for this. Go back to the save_data.Rmd file and add the following, under the function definition of get_laspeyeres():\n```{r tests-get_laspeyeres}\ntest_that(\"Wrong data\", {\n\n  expect_error(\n    get_laspeyeres(mtcars)\n  )\n\n})\n```\nSince we expect an error, we used expect_error(), which succeeds if the code fails! If you’re confused, no worries, we’ve all been there. But let’s think about it: what would you want to happen if you provided a wrong data set? Surely, you’d like for the function to scream an error at you, and not somehow do something and return something. So testing that functions fail when they should is actually quite important as well. Let’s add another, similar, test:\n```{r tests-get_laspeyeres}\n\ntest_that(\"Wrong data\", {\n\n  expect_error(\n    get_laspeyeres(mtcars)\n  )\n\n})\n\ntest_that(\"Empty data\", {\n\n  expect_error(\n  # this subsetting results in an empty dataset\n    get_laspeyeres(subset(mtcars, am == 2))\n  )\n\n})\n\n```\nThis second test checks what happens if we provide an empty dataset. This should not happen, but hey, it’s always a good idea to see what could happen. Here we also expect an error, so we use expect_error() as well. Inflating save_data.Rmd runs the tests again, and all of them succeed.\nNow, I know what you’re thinking. Probably something along the lines of “Bruno, you told me that making my projects reproducible and reliable and robust would not take much more time than what I was already doing before. This certainly doesn’t feel like it!”, to which I answer that your feelings on the issue are wrong. It may not feel like it, but doing this does two things:\n\nIt ultimately saves you time. You typed the test once, and can now rerun it automatically every time you inflate the .Rmd files. You don’t need to remember to test the code, and don’t need to remember how to test the code.\nThis saves you a lot of headaches. You don’t have to live in fear that you might forget to test the code, or forget how to test the code. You wrote the tests down, and now you’re free to concentrate on adding features or using the existing code knowing that you can trust its outputs.\n\nTrust the process.\nLet’s go back to the two tests from before: get_laspeyeres() fails, as expected, when we provide a random dataset to it. But it would be interesting to know why it fails. Simply run get_laspeyeres(mtcars) in the console. This is what we get back:\nError in `mutate()`:\n! Problem while computing `p0 = ifelse(year == \"2010\",\n  average_price_nominal_euros, NA)`.\nCaused by error in `ifelse()`:\n! object 'year' not found\nRun `rlang::last_error()` to see where the error occurred.\nSo the functions fails but for the wrong reason. It fails because the column year cannot be found in the data. But what if there was a column year in the data? The code would continue, but then likely fail for some other reason. It would be much safer to make it fail as soon as possible, by detecting right from the start if the provided data sets are not one of commune_level_data or country_level_data. But for this, we need assertive programming, which we will discuss in the next section. Why an assertive test and not an unit test? Because unit tests should run during development time, and assertive tests run at run-time (whent the function is executed). So in this case, we want the input to get checked at run-tim. In the next section we will be changing the function to fail when the right datasets are not provided, but our unit test will not need to change; the function still fails, but this time it’ll be for the right reasons.\nThis is another advantage of writing tests: it forces you to think about what you’re doing. The simple act of thinking and writing tests very often improves your code quite a lot, and not just from a pure algorithmic perspective, but also from a user experience perspective. Writing these tests made us think about the failure of our function when users provide a wrong dataset, and made us realise that it would be much better for users if the returned error message is something along the lines of “Wrong dataset, please provide either commune_level_data or country_level_data”.\nLet’s continue with testing get_laspeyeres(). It would be nice to see if the function actually does what it’s supposed to do correctly. For this, we need to start from an input, and then create the expected output. It doesn’t matter how you create this output, what matters is that you make absolutely sure that it is correct, and then, never touch it ever again. Let’s call this output the “truth”. Then, you provide get_laspeyeres() with this input and save the output that get_laspeyeres() generates. You then compare the “truth” to this output. If everything matches, congratulations, your function produces the right output.\nSo let’s start. Remember that unit tests should be self-contained, so I’m going to create the input dataset and the expected data set (what I called the “truth”) in the test itself. This is the code I’m going to use to create the mock, input dataset:\n\ninput_df &lt;- expand.grid(\n  list(\"year\" = c(2010, 2011),\n       \"locality\" = c(\"Bascharage\", \"Luxembourg\"))\n)\n\ninput_df$n_offers &lt;- c(123, 101, 1230, 1010)\ninput_df$average_price_nominal_euros &lt;- c(234, 345, 560, 670)\ninput_df$average_price_m2_nominal_euros &lt;- c(23, 34, 56, 67)\n\nThis creates a data frame with two years, two communes and some mock prices. Now, I need to create the output. I start from the input, and add the columns that get computed by running get_laspeyeres() myself, “by hand”. Remember, you need to make sure that these results are correct!\n\nexpected_df &lt;- input_df\n\n# p0 should be always equal to the value in the first year\nexpected_df$p0 &lt;- c(234, 234, 560, 560)\nexpected_df$p0_m2 &lt;- c(23, 23, 56, 56)\n\n# pl should be equal to the price divided by p0\nexpected_df$pl &lt;-\n  expected_df$average_price_nominal_euros/\n    expected_df$p0 * 100\n\nexpected_df$pl_m2 &lt;-\n  expected_df$average_price_m2_nominal_euros/\n    expected_df$p0_m2 * 100\n\nIf you look at each line, you see that this is exactly what get_laspeyeres() does. We can inspect the results, maybe even verify the value of each cell using a pocket calculator. It doesn’t matter, what’s important is that expected_df is correct and saved. This is what the full test looks like:\n```{r, eval = F}\ntest_that(\"get_laspeyeres() produces correct results\", {\n\n  input_df &lt;- expand.grid(\n    list(\"year\" = c(2010, 2011),\n         \"locality\" = c(\"Bascharage\", \"Luxembourg\"))\n  )\n\n  input_df$n_offers &lt;- c(123, 101, 1230, 1010)\n  input_df$average_price_nominal_euros &lt;- c(234, 345, 560, 670)\n  input_df$average_price_m2_nominal_euros &lt;- c(23, 34, 56, 67)\n\n  expected_df &lt;- input_df\n\n  # p0 should be always equal to the value in the first year\n  expected_df$p0 &lt;- c(234, 234, 560, 560)\n  expected_df$p0_m2 &lt;- c(23, 23, 56, 56)\n\n  # pl should be equal to the price divided by p0\n  expected_df$pl &lt;- expected_df$average_price_nominal_euros/expected_df$p0 * 100\n  expected_df$pl_m2 &lt;- expected_df$average_price_m2_nominal_euros/expected_df$p0_m2 * 100\n\n  expect_equivalent(\n    expected_df, get_laspeyeres(input_df)\n  )\n\n})\n```\nNotice that I’ve used expect_equivalent() and not expect_equal() to check if expected_df is equal to the output of get_laspeyeres(input_df). This is because expected_df is of class data.frame, while get_laspeyeres() outputs a tibble. So if you use expect_equal() the test would not pass, because the classes of both objects are not strictly equal. Sometimes, this level of strictness is required, but not always, as is the case here.\nOnce again, inflate save_data.Rmd. This will run the tests, and if everything went well, you should end up, again, with a functioning package. I highly advise that you consult {testthat}’s documentation to learn about all the other functions that you can use for writing unit tests.\nIf you’ve managed to write the unit tests and inflate the package successfully, then let’s move on to assertive programming."

    "section": "12.2 Assertive programming",
    "text": "12.2 Assertive programming\nRemember in chapter 6, where I discussed safe functions? As a refresher, here’s the nchar() function, providing a correct output when the input is a character:\n\nnchar(\"100000000\")\n\n[1] 9\n\n\nand here is nchar() providing a surprising result when the input is a number:\n\nnchar(100000000)\n\n[1] 5\n\n\nThis is because 100000000 gets converted to 1e+08 and then this gets converted into the string \"1e+08\" which is 5 characters long. So in that section, I suggested to define your own nchar2() that makes sure that the provided input is a character:\n\nnchar2 &lt;- function(x, result = 0){\n\n  if(!isTRUE(is.character(x))){\n    stop(paste0(\"x should be of type 'character', but is of type '\",\n                typeof(x), \"' instead.\"))\n  } else if(x == \"\"){\n    result\n  } else {\n    result &lt;- result + 1\n    split_x &lt;- strsplit(x, split = \"\")[[1]]\n    nchar2(paste0(split_x[-1],\n                  collapse = \"\"), result)\n  }\n}\n\nThis now returns an error if the input is a number, instead of doing all these silent conversions. The technique we have used here is what we call assertive programming. stop() and stopifnot() are functions included with R that can be used for assertive programming. Here is an example using stopifnot():\n\nnchar3 &lt;- function(x, result = 0){\n\n  stopifnot(\"Input x must be a character\" =\n              isTRUE(is.character(x)))\n\n  if(x == \"\"){\n    result\n  } else {\n    result &lt;- result + 1\n    split_x &lt;- strsplit(x, split = \"\")[[1]]\n    nchar3(paste0(split_x[-1],\n                  collapse = \"\"), result)\n  }\n}\n\nIf we go back to get_laspeyeres(), we should be using assertive programming to make sure that the provided datasets are one of commune_level_data or country_level_data. This is how we could rewrite the function:\n\nget_laspeyeres &lt;- function(dataset){\n\n  which_dataset &lt;- deparse(substitute(dataset))\n\n  stopifnot(\"dataset must be one of `commune_level_data`\n             or `country_level_data`\" =\n              (which_dataset %in% c(\"commune_level_data\",\n                                    \"country_level_data\")))\n\n  group_var &lt;- if(grepl(\"commune\", which_dataset)){\n                 quo(locality)\n               } else {\n                 NULL\n               }\n  dataset |&gt;\n    group_by(!!group_var) |&gt;\n    mutate(\n      p0 = ifelse(\n        year == \"2010\",\n        average_price_nominal_euros,\n        NA)\n    ) |&gt;\n    fill(p0, .direction = \"down\") |&gt;\n    mutate(\n      p0_m2 = ifelse(\n        year == \"2010\",\n        average_price_m2_nominal_euros,\n        NA)\n    ) |&gt;\n    fill(p0_m2, .direction = \"down\") |&gt;\n    ungroup() |&gt;\n    mutate(pl = average_price_nominal_euros/p0*100,\n           pl_m2 = average_price_m2_nominal_euros/p0_m2*100)\n\n}\n\nWe can now also edit the unit test from before, the one where we provide the wrong data. With this new specification of the function, this unit test would still pass (the function returns an error), as expected, but for the wrong reason. We now want to make sure that it fails for the right reason, in other words, that it fails not because no year column is found, but because the provided data set is neither commune_level_data nor country_level_data, so for this we change the unit tests like this:\n\ntest_that(\"Wrong data\", {\n\n  expect_error(\n    get_laspeyeres(mtcars),\n    regexp = \"dataset must be one of\"\n  )\n\n})\n\nI use the regexp argument of expect_error to enter a regular expression that matches the error message. So the string “dataset must be one of” will match the message returned by the error, and if they match (remember, the provided string is a regular expression), then I know I get the correct error. Here is what happens if I use the wrong message as the regex argument:\n══ Failed tests ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n── Failure ('test-get_laspeyeres.R:6'): Wrong data ─────────────────────────────\n`get_laspeyeres(mtcars)` threw an error with unexpected message.\nExpected match: \"message is wrong\"\nActual message: \"dataset must be one of `commune_level_data`\n                   or `country_level_data`\"\nSo now, not only does our function fail for the right reasons, our test is able to tell us that as well!\nBefore inflating to run these tests, you should also change the test titled “get_laspeyeres() provides correct answers”. This is because the name of the input dataset used for the test is input_df. So if you leave it like this, the assertion that we’ve included in the function will make this test fail. So change this test by simply saving input_df commune_level_data:\n\n# rename data to make assertion pass\ncommune_level_data &lt;- input_df\n\nexpect_equivalent(\n  expected_df, get_laspeyeres(commune_level_data)\n)\n\nif you forget to do this, don’t worry, the unit test would not fail to remind you!\nGo back to 0-dev_history.Rmd and inflate the file again to update it. Everything should work without any issues. If not, take the time to make the unit tests pass and inflate the package successfully!\nSomething else that is well-suited for assertive programming is checking whether the provided inputs are of the right class:\n\nany_function &lt;- function(dataset){\n\n  stopifnot(\"`dataset` must be a data frame\" =\n              inherits(dataset, \"data.frame\"))\n\n  print(\"No problem\")\n}\n\nThis will succeed:\n\nany_function(mtcars)\n\n[1] \"No problem\"\n\n\nBut this will fail:\n\nany_function(\"this is not a data frame\")\n\nError in any_function(\"this is not a data frame\") : \n  `dataset` must be a data frame\ninherits() checks if an object inherits from a certain class. So for example, a tibble or a data.table that are classes that are defined by inheriting attributes from the data.frame class, will also successfully pass the test above. You can be as strict as you need: for example, do you need any type of number? You could do the following:\n\ninherits(2, \"numeric\")\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nBut do you actually need integers, and want to force this? Then you could be stricter in your assertion:\n\ninherits(2, \"integer\")\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\nIf you want the above to evaluate to TRUE, an integer must be provided:\n\ninherits(2L, \"integer\")\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nDo you want, for some reason, that your functions only accept tibbles and not data.frames? Be as strict as you need. This will succeed:\n\ninherits(tibble::as_tibble(mtcars), \"tbl_df\")\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nThis will fail:\n\ninherits(mtcars, \"tbl_df\")\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\nYou could also use more complex assertions. For example, suppose that you need to clean data using many functions, with several filters. Something could go wrong in any of these functions for a variety of reasons. So each of these functions could test if all the individuals are still in the data, and that you didn’t remove any of them by mistake. A test like this could make sure that each levels of the variable am are still in the data:\n\nsummary_stats &lt;- function(dataframe, var){\n  stopifnot(\"Some individuals are missing!\" =\n              all((unique(dataframe[[var]])) %in% c(0,1)))\n\n  # and then some comptutations here\n}\n\nNow, when running summary_stats(mtcars, \"am\"), if somehow the level “1” or “0” is missing from mtcars, the function would throw an error.\nThere are several packages for assertive programming that you might want to check out:\n\n{assertthat}1\n{chk}2\n{checkmate}3\n\nI won’t discuss any of them; what’s important is for you to know that assertive programming is something that is useful, and that you should add to your toolbox."

Of course, since there is no function to test, these tests will all obviously fail at first. But the goal is to then write a function such that the tests pass.\nTDD is interesting in at least two scenarios:\n\nYou want to write a function, but don’t know exactly where to start. Maybe it’s a very complex function. So writing tests can help you think about it, and already fix certain properties that this function should have.\nYou use the tests as a way to write requirements for a code-base. This can be useful when working in a team, and you don’t want to “waste” time writing requirements, so instead you write tests that describe how the function should work, what type of inputs get accepted, how its output looks like… Careful though, because a “smart” programmer could write code that passes the tests but doesn’t actually do anything otherwise useful.\n\nI tend to use TDD when I need to write a function but don’t quite know where to start. I start by writing the most basic tests and make them ever more complicated. At some point, I start having an idea for the function’s implementation and have a go at it.\nSome programmers only do TDD; so they start by writing many, many tests, and then only start writing their functions. Personally, I think that this is also not ideal, because you could waste a lot of time writing meaningless tests."

For example, suppose that you have an if...else... clause somewhere in a function. Did you write a test for each of the outcomes of this clause? Maybe you only wrote a test when this clause evaluates to TRUE, but forgot to write a test for the case it is FALSE.\nThe packages {covr} allows you to track the test coverage of your package.

We see that the share of lines being tested in get_laspeyeres.R is 57%: this is because the script get_laspeyeres.R contains two functions, get_laspeyeres() and make_plot(). We do not test make_plot() at all, hence why the percentage is so low. We could move make_plot() to another script by simply putting the function under a level two header in the original .Rmd file and then inflating again. But in any case, this would not improve the overall coverage of the package; we would ideally need to write a test for make_plot(). This is left as an exercise to the reader."

Not just because it gives you peace of mind but also because writing tests forces you to think about your code, by putting yourself in the shoes of your users (which include future you as well). In most cases, it is even something that you’ve been doing but perhaps not as systematically as you should.\nThere really is no other way to say this: you need to consider writing tests as an integral part of the project, and need to take the required time it takes to write them into account when planning projects. But keep in mind that writing them makes you gain a lot of time in the long run, so actually, you might even be faster by writing tests! Tests also allow you to immediately see where something went wrong, when something goes wrong. So tests save you time here as well. Without tests, when something goes wrong, you have a hard time finding where the bug comes from, and end up wasting precious time. And worse, sometimes things go wrong and break, but silently. You still get an output that may look ok at first glance, and only realise something is wrong way too late. Testing helps avoiding such situations.\nSo remember: it might feel like packaging your code and writing tests for it takes time, butyou’re actually already doing it, but non-systematically and manually and it ends up saving you time in the long run instead. Testing also helps with developing complex functions.\nThe tools I’ve showed you in this and the previous chapter are probably the fastest, easiest options to go from your analysis to a documented and tested package in a matter of hours. The benefits these provide however are measured in days of work."

    "text": "13.1 Introduction\nScript-based workflows are problematic for several reasons. The first is that scripts can, and will, be executed out of order. You can mitigate some of the problems this can create by using pure functions, but you still need to make sure not to run the scripts out of order. But what does that actually mean? Well, suppose that you changed a function, and only want to re-execute the parts of the pipeline that are impacted by that change. But this supposes that you can know, in your head, which part of the script was impacted and which was not. And this can be quite difficult to figure out, especially when the pipeline is huge. So you will run certain parts of the script, and not others, in the hope that you don’t need to re-run everything.\nAnother issue is that pipelines written as scripts are usually quite difficult to read and understand. To mitigate this, what you’d typically do is write a lot of comments. But here again you face the problem of needing to maintain these comments, and once the comments and the code are out of synch… the problems start (or rather, they continue).\nRunning the different parts of the pipeline in parallel is also very complicated if your pipeline is defined as script. You would need to break the script into independent parts (and make really sure that these parts are independent) and execute them in parallel, perhaps using a separate R session for each script. The good news is that if you followed the advice from this book you have been using functional programming and so your pipeline is a series of pure function calls, which simplifies running the pipeline in parallel.\nBut by now you should know that software engineers also faced similar problems when they needed to build their software, and you should also suspect that they likely came up with something to alleviate these issues. Enter build automation tools.\nWhen using a build automation tool, what you end up doing is writing down a recipe that defines how the source code should be “cooked” into the software (or in our case, a report, a cleaned dataset or any data product).\nThe build automation tool then tracks:\n\nany change in any of the code. Only the outputs that are affected by the changes you did will be re-computed (and their dependencies as well);\nany change in any of the tracked files. For example, if a file gets updated daily, you can track this file and the build automation tool will only execute the parts of the pipeline affected by this update;\nwhich parts of the pipeline can safely run in parallel (with the option to thus run the pipeline on multiple CPU cores).\n\nJust like many of the other tools that we have encountered in this book, what build automation tools do is allow you to not have to rely on your brain. You write down the recipe once, and then you can focus again on just the code of your actual project. You shouldn’t have to think about the pipeline itself, nor think about how to best run it. Let your computer figure that out for you, it’s much better at such tasks than you."

    "text": "13.2 {targets} quick-start\nFirst thing’s first: to know everything about the {targets} package, you should read the excellent {targets} manual1. Everything’s in there. So what I’m going to do is really just give you a very quick intro to what I think are really the main points you should know about to get started.\nLet’s start with a “hello-world” type pipeline. Create a new folder called something like targets_intro/, and start a fresh R session in it. For now, let’s ignore {renv}. We will see how {renv} works together with {targets} to provide an (almost reproducible) pipeline later. In that fresh session inside the targets_intro/ run the following line:\n\ntargets::tar_script()\n\nthis will create a template _targets.R file in that directory. This is the file in which we will define our pipeline. Open in it in your favourite editor. A _targets.R pipeline is roughly divided into three parts:\n\nfirst is where packages are loaded and helper functions are defined;\nsecond is where pipeline-specific options are defined;\nthird is the pipeline itself, defined as a series of targets.\n\nLet’s go through all these parts one by one.\n\n13.2.1 _targets.R’s anatomy\nThe first part of the pipeline is where packages and helper functions get loaded. In the template, the very first line is a library(targets) call followed by a function definition. There are two important things here that you need to understand.\nIf your pipeline needs, say, the {dplyr} package to run, you could write library(dplyr) right after the library(targets) call. However, it is best to actually do as in the template, and load the packages using tar_option_set(packages = \"dplyr\"). This is because if you execute the pipeline in parallel, you need to make sure that all the packages are available to all the workers (typically, one worker per CPU core). If you load the packages at the top of the _targets.R script, the packages will be available for the original session that called library(...), but not to any worker sessions spawned for parallel execution.\nSo, the idea is that at the very top of your script, you only load the {targets} library and other packages that are required for running the pipeline itself (as we shall see in coming sections). But packages that are required by functions that are running inside the pipeline should ideally be loaded as in the template. Another way of saying this: at the top of the script, think “pipeline infrastructure” packages ({targets} and some others), but inside tar_option_set() think “functions that run inside the pipeline” packages.\nPart two is where you set some global options for the pipeline. As discussed previously, this is where you should load packages that are required by the functions that are called inside the pipeline. I won’t list all the options here, because I would simply be repeating what’s in the documentation2. This second part is also where you can define some functions that you might need for running the pipeline. For example, you might need to define a function to load and clean some data: this is where you would do so. We have developed a package, so we do not need such a function, we will simply load the data from the package directly. But sometimes your analysis doesn’t require you to write any custom functions, or maybe just a few, and perhaps you don’t see the benefit of building a package just for one or two functions. So instead, you have two other options: you either define them directly inside the _targets.R script, like in the template, or you create a functions/ folder next to the _targets.R script, and put your functions there. It’s up to you, but I prefer this second option. In the example script, the following function is defined:\n\nsummarize_data &lt;- function(dataset) {\n  colMeans(dataset)\n}\n\nFinally, comes the pipeline itself. Let’s take a closer look at it:\n\nlist(\n  tar_target(data,\n             data.frame(x = sample.int(100),\n                        y = sample.int(100))),\n\n  tar_target(data_summary,\n             summarize_data(data)) # Call your custom functions.\n)\n\nThe pipeline is nothing but a list (told you lists where a very important object) of targets. A target is defined using the targets::tar_target() function and has at least two inputs: the first is the name of the target (without quotes) and the second is the function that generates the target. So a target defined as tar_target(y, f(x)) can be understood as y &lt;- f(x). The next target can use the output of the previous target as an input, so you could have something like tar_target(z, f(y)) (just like in the template)."

    "text": "13.3 A pipeline is a composition of pure functions\nYou can run this pipeline by typing targets::tar_make() in a console:\n\ntargets::tar_make()\n\n• start target data\n• built target data [0.82 seconds]\n• start target data_summary\n• built target data_summary [0.02 seconds]\n• end pipeline [1.71 seconds]\nThe pipeline is done running! So, now what? This pipeline simply built some summary statistics, but where are they? Typing data_summary in the console to try to inspect this output results in the following:\n\ndata_summary\n\nError: object 'data_summary' not found\nWhat is going on?\nFirst, you need to remember our chapter on functional programming. We want our pipeline to be a sequence of pure functions. This means that our pipeline running successfully should not depend on anything in the global environment (apart from loading the packages in the first part of the script, and the options set with tar_option_set() for the others) and it should not change anything outside of its scope. This means that the pipeline should not change anything in the global environment either. This is exactly how a {targets} pipeline operates. A pipeline defined using {targets} will be pure and so the output of the pipeline will not be saved in the global environment. Now, strictly speaking, the pipeline is not exactly pure. Check the folder that contains the _targets.R script. There should now be a _targets/ folder in there as well. If you go inside that folder, and then open the objects/ folder, you should see two objects, data and data_summary. These are the outputs of our pipeline.\nSo each target that is defined inside the pipeline gets saved there in the .rds format. This is an R-specific format that you can use to save any type of object. It doesn’t matter what it is: a simple data frame, a fitted model, a ggplot, whatever, you can write any R object to disk in this format using the saveRDS() function, and then read it back into another R session using readRDS(). {targets} makes use of these two functions to save every target computed by your pipeline, and simply retrieves them from the _targets/ folder instead of recomputing them. Keep this in mind if you use Git to version the code of your pipeline (which you are doing of course), and add the _targets/ folder to the .gitignore (unless you really want to also version it, but it shouldn’t be necessary).\nSo because the pipeline is pure, and none of its outputs get saved into the global environment, calling data_summary results in the error above. So to retrieve the outputs you should use targets::tar_read() or targets::tar_load(). The difference is that tar_read() simply reads the output and shows it in the console but tar_load() reads and saves the object into the global environment. So to retrieve our data_summary object let’s use tar_load(data_summary):\n\ntar_load(data_summary)\n\nNow, typing data_summary shows the computed output:\n\ndata_summary\n\n\n   x    y\n50.5 50.5\n\nIt is possible to load all the outputs using targets::tar_load_everything() so that you don’t need to load each output one by one.\nBefore continuing with more {targets} features, I want to really stress the fact that the pipeline is the composition of pure functions. So functions that only have a side-effect will be difficult to handle. Examples of such functions are functions that read data, or that print something to the screen. For example, plotting in base R consists of a series of calls to functions with side-effects. If you open an R console and type plot(mtcars), you will see a plot. But the function plot() does not create any output. It just prints a picture on your screen, which is a side-effect. To convince yourself that plot() does not create any output and only has a side-effect, try to save the output of plot() in a variable:\n\na &lt;- plot(mtcars)\n\ndoing this will show the plot, but if you then call a, the plot will not appear, and instead you will get NULL:\n\na\n\n\nNULL\n\nThis is also why saving plots in R is awkward, it’s because there’s no object to actually save!\nSo because plot() is not a pure function, if you try to use it in a {targets} pipeline, you will get NULL as well when loading the target that should be holding the plot. To see this, change the list of targets like this:\n\nlist(\n  tar_target(data,\n             data.frame(x = sample.int(100),\n                        y = sample.int(100))),\n\n  tar_target(data_summary,\n             summarize_data(data)), # Call your custom functions.\n\n  tar_target(\n    data_plot,\n    plot(data)\n  )\n)\n\nI’ve simply added a new target using tar_target() at the end, to generate a plot. Run the pipeline again using tar_make() and then type tar_load(data_plot) to load the data_plot target. But typing data_plot only shows NULL and not the plot!\nThere are several workarounds for this. The first is to use ggplot() instead. This is because the output of ggplot() is an object of type ggplot. You can do something like a &lt;- ggplot() + etc... and then type a to see the plot. Doing str(a) also shows the underlying list holding the structure of the plot, as a list.\nThe second workaround is to save the plot to disk. For this, you need to write a new function, for example:\n\nsave_plot &lt;- function(filename, ...){\n\n  png(filename = filename)\n  plot(...)\n  dev.off()\n\n}\n\nIf you put this in the _targets.R script, before defining the list of tar_target objects, you could use this instead of plot() in the last target:\n\nsummarize_data &lt;- function(dataset) {\n  colMeans(dataset)\n}\n\nsave_plot &lt;- function(filename, ...){\n  png(filename = filename)\n  plot(...)\n  dev.off()\n\n  filename\n}\n\n# Set target-specific options such as packages.\ntar_option_set(packages = \"dplyr\")\n\n# End this file with a list of target objects.\nlist(\n  tar_target(data,\n             data.frame(x = sample.int(100),\n                        y = sample.int(100))),\n\n  tar_target(data_summary,\n             summarize_data(data)), # Call your custom functions.\n\n  tar_target(\n    data_plot,\n    save_plot(\n      filename = \"my_plot.png\",\n      data),\n    format = \"file\")\n)\n\nAfter running this pipeline you should see a file called my_plot.png in the folder of your pipeline. If you type tar_load(data_plot), and then data_plot you will see that this target returns the filename argument of save_plot(). This is because a target needs to return something, and in the case of functions that save a file to disk returning the path where the file gets saved is recommended. This is because if I then need to use this file in another target, I could do tar_target(x, f(data_plot)). Because the data_plot target returns a path, I can write f() in such a way that it knows how to handle this path. If instead I write tar_target(x, f(\"path/to/my_plot.png\")), then {targets} would have no way of knowing that the target x depends on the target data_plot. The dependency between these two targets would break. Hence why the first option is preferable.\nFinally, you will have noticed that the last target also has the option format = \"file\". This will be topic of the next section.\nIt is worth noting that the {ggplot2} package includes a function to save ggplot objects to disk called ggplot2::ggsave(). So you could define two targets, one to compute the ggplot object itself, and another to generate a .png image of that ggplot object."

First, run the following lines in the folder that contains the _targets.R script that we’ve been using up until now:\n\ndata(mtcars)\n\nwrite.csv(mtcars,\n          \"mtcars.csv\",\n          row.names = F)\n\nThis will create the file \"mtcars.csv\" in that folder. We are going to use this in our pipeline.\nWrite the pipeline like this:\n\nlist(\n  tar_target(\n    data_mtcars,\n    read.csv(\"mtcars.csv\")\n  ),\n\n  tar_target(\n    summary_mtcars,\n    summary(data_mtcars)\n  ),\n\n  tar_target(\n    plot_mtcars,\n    save_plot(\n      filename = \"mtcars_plot.png\",\n      data_mtcars),\n    format = \"file\")\n)\n\nYou can now run the pipeline and will get a plot at the end. The problem however, is that the input file \"mtcars.csv\" is not being tracked for changes. Try to change the file, for example by running this line in the console:\n\nwrite.csv(head(mtcars), \"mtcars.csv\", row.names = F)\n\nIf you try to run the pipeline again, our changes to the data are ignored:\n✔ skip target data_mtcars\n✔ skip target plot_mtcars\n✔ skip target summary_mtcars\n✔ skip pipeline [0.1 seconds]\nAs you can see, because {targets} is not tracking the changes in the mtcars.csv file, from its point of view nothing changed. And thus the pipeline gets skipped because according to {targets}, it is up-to-date.\nLet’s change the csv back:\n\nwrite.csv(mtcars, \"mtcars.csv\", row.names = F)\n\nand change the first target such that the file gets tracked. Remember that targets need to be pure functions and return something. So we are going to change the first target to simply return the path to the file, and use the format = \"file\" option in tar_target():\n\npath_data &lt;- function(path){\n  path\n}\n\nlist(\n  tar_target(\n    path_data_mtcars,\n    path_data(\"mtcars.csv\"),\n    format = \"file\"\n  ),\n  tar_target(\n    data_mtcars,\n    read.csv(path_data_mtcars)\n  ),\n  tar_target(\n    summary_mtcars,\n    summary(data_mtcars)\n  ),\n  tar_target(\n    plot_mtcars,\n    save_plot(filename = \"mtcars_plot.png\",\n              data_mtcars),\n    format = \"file\")\n)\n\nTo drive the point home, I use a function called path_data() which takes a path as an input and simply returns it. This is totally superfluous, and you could define the target like this instead:\n\ntar_target(\n  path_data_mtcars,\n  \"mtcars.csv\",\n  format = \"file\"\n)\n\nThis would have exactly the same effect as using the path_data() function.\nSo now we got a target called path_data_mtcars that returns nothing but the path to the data. But because we’ve used the format = \"file\" option, {targets} now knows that this is a file that must be tracked. So any change on this file will be correctly recognised and any target that depends on this input file will be marked as being out-of-date. The other targets are exactly the same.\nRun the pipeline now using targets::tar_make(). Now, change the input file again:\n\nwrite.csv(head(mtcars),\n          \"mtcars.csv\",\n          row.names = F)\n\nNow, run the pipeline again using targets::tar_make(): this time you should see that {targets} correctly identified the change and runs the pipeline again accordingly!"

    "text": "13.5 The dependency graph\nAs you’ve seen in the previous section (and as I told you in the introduction) {targets} keeps track of changes in files, but also in the functions that you use. Any change to the code of any of these functions will result in {targets} identifying which targets are now out-of-date and which should be re-computed (alongside any other target that depends on them). It is possible to visualise this using targets::tar_visnetwork(). This opens an interactive network graph in your web browser that looks like this:\n\n\n\nThis image opens in your web-browser.\n\n\nIn the image above, each target has been computed, so they are all up-to-date. If you now change the input data, here is what you will see instead:\n\n\n\nBecause the input data was changed, we need to run the pipeline again.\n\n\nBecause all the targets depend on the input data, we need to re-run everything. Let’s run the pipeline again to update all the targets using tar_make() before continuing.\nNow let’s add another target to our pipeline, one that does not depend on the input data. Then, we will modify the input data again, and call tar_visnetwork() again. Change the pipeline like so:\n\nlist(\n  tar_target(\n    path_data_mtcars,\n    \"mtcars.csv\",\n    format = \"file\"\n  ),\n  tar_target(\n    data_iris,\n    data(\"iris\")\n  ),\n  tar_target(\n    summary_iris,\n    summary(data_iris)\n  ),\n  tar_target(\n    data_mtcars,\n    read.csv(path_data_mtcars)\n  ),\n  tar_target(\n    summary_mtcars,\n    summary(data_mtcars)\n  ),\n  tar_target(\n    plot_mtcars,\n    save_plot(\n      filename = \"mtcars_plot.png\",\n      data_mtcars),\n    format = \"file\")\n)\n\nBefore running the pipeline, we can call targets::tar_visnetwork() again to see the entire workflow:\n\n\n\nWe clearly see that the pipeline has two completely independent parts.\n\n\nWe can see that there are now two independent parts, as well as two unused functions, path_data() and summ() which we could remove.\nRunning the pipeline using targets::tar_make() builds everything successfully. Let’s add the following target, just before the very last one:\n\ntar_target(\n  list_summaries,\n  list(\n    \"summary_iris\" = summary_iris,\n    \"summary_mtcars\" = summary_mtcars\n  )\n),\n\nThis target creates a list with the two summaries that we compute. Call targets::tar_visnetwork() again:\n\n\n\nThe two separate workflows end up in one output.\n\n\nFinally, run the pipeline one last time to compute the final output."

    "text": "13.6 Running the pipeline in parallel\n{targets} makes it easy to run independent parts of our pipeline in parallel. In the example from before, it was quite obvious to know which parts were independent, but when the pipeline grows in complexity, it can be very difficult to see which parts are independent.\nLet’s now run the example from before in parallel. But first, we need to create a function that takes some time to run. summary() is so quick that running both of its calls in parallel is not worth it (and would actually even run slower, I’ll explain why at the end). Let’s define a new function called slow_summary():\n\nslow_summary &lt;- function(...){\n  Sys.sleep(30)\n  summary(...)\n}\n\nand replace every call to summary() with slow_summary() in the pipeline:\n\nlist(\n  tar_target(\n    path_data_mtcars,\n    \"mtcars.csv\",\n    format = \"file\"\n  ),\n  tar_target(\n    data_iris,\n    data(\"iris\")\n  ),\n  tar_target(\n    summary_iris,\n    slow_summary(data_iris)\n  ),\n  tar_target(\n    data_mtcars,\n    read.csv(path_data_mtcars)\n  ),\n  tar_target(\n    summary_mtcars,\n    slow_summary(data_mtcars)\n  ),\n  tar_target(\n    list_summaries,\n    list(\n      \"summary_iris\" = summary_iris,\n      \"summary_mtcars\" = summary_mtcars\n    )\n  ),\n  tar_target(\n    plot_mtcars,\n    save_plot(filename = \"mtcars_plot.png\",\n              data_mtcars),\n    format = \"file\")\n)\n\nhere’s what the pipeline looks like before running:\n\n\n\nslow_summary() is used instead of summary().\n\n\n(You will also notice that I’ve removed the unneeded functions, path_data() and summ()).\nRunning this pipeline sequentially will take about a minute, because each call to slow_summary() takes 30 seconds. To re-run the pipeline completely from scratch, call targets::tar_destroy(). This will make all the targets outdated. Then, run the pipeline from scratch with targets::tar_make():\n\ntargets::tar_make()\n\n• start target path_data_mtcars\n• built target path_data_mtcars [0.18 seconds]\n• start target data_iris\n• built target data_iris [0 seconds]\n• start target data_mtcars\n• built target data_mtcars [0 seconds]\n• start target summary_iris\n• built target summary_iris [30.26 seconds]\n• start target plot_mtcars\n• built target plot_mtcars [0.16 seconds]\n• start target summary_mtcars\n• built target summary_mtcars [30.29 seconds]\n• start target list_summaries\n• built target list_summaries [0 seconds]\n• end pipeline [1.019 minutes]\nSince computing summary_iris is completely independent of summary_mtcars, these two computations could be running at the same time on two separate CPU cores. To do this, we need to first load two additional packages, {future} and {future.callr} at the top of the script. Then, we also need to call plan(callr) before defining our pipeline. Here is what the complete _targets.R looks like:\n\nlibrary(targets)\nlibrary(future)\nlibrary(future.callr)\nplan(callr)\n\n# Sometimes you gotta take your time\nslow_summary &lt;- function(...) {\n  Sys.sleep(30)\n  summary(...)\n}\n\n# Save plot to disk\nsave_plot &lt;- function(filename, ...){\n  png(filename = filename)\n  plot(...)\n  dev.off()\n\n  filename\n}\n\n# Set target-specific options such as packages.\ntar_option_set(packages = \"dplyr\")\n\nlist(\n  tar_target(\n    path_data_mtcars,\n    \"mtcars.csv\",\n    format = \"file\"\n  ),\n  tar_target(\n    data_iris,\n    data(\"iris\")\n  ),\n  tar_target(\n    summary_iris,\n    slow_summary(data_iris)\n  ),\n  tar_target(\n    data_mtcars,\n    read.csv(path_data_mtcars)\n  ),\n  tar_target(\n    summary_mtcars,\n    slow_summary(data_mtcars)\n  ),\n  tar_target(\n    list_summaries,\n    list(\n      \"summary_iris\" = summary_iris,\n      \"summary_mtcars\" = summary_mtcars\n    )\n  ),\n  tar_target(\n    plot_mtcars,\n    save_plot(\n      filename = \"mtcars_plot.png\",\n      data_mtcars),\n    format = \"file\")\n)\n\nYou can now run this pipeline in parallel using targets::tar_make_future() (and sequentially as well, just as usual with targets::tar_make()). To run the pipeline from scratch to test this, call targets::tar_destroy() and then targets::tar_make() will build the entire pipeline from scratch:\n# Set workers = 2 to use 2 cpu cores\ntargets::tar_make_future(workers = 2)\n• start target path_data_mtcars\n• start target data_iris\n• built target path_data_mtcars [0.2 seconds]\n• start target data_mtcars\n• built target data_iris [0.22 seconds]\n• start target summary_iris\n• built target data_mtcars [0.2 seconds]\n• start target plot_mtcars\n• built target plot_mtcars [0.35 seconds]\n• start target summary_mtcars\n• built target summary_iris [30.5 seconds]\n• built target summary_mtcars [30.52 seconds]\n• start target list_summaries\n• built target list_summaries [0.21 seconds]\n• end pipeline [38.72 seconds]\nAs you can see, this was faster but not quite twice as fast, but almost. The reason this isn’t exactly twice as fast is because there is some overhead to run code in parallel. New R sessions have to be spawned by {targets}, data needs to be transferred and packages must be loaded in these new sessions. This is why it’s only worth parallelizing code that takes some time to run. If you decrease the number of sleep seconds in slow_summary(...) (for example to 10), running the code in parallel might be slower than running the code sequentially, because of that overhead. But if you have several long-running computations, it’s really worth the very small price that you pay for the initial setup. Let me re-iterate again that in order to run your pipeline in parallel, the extra worker sessions that get spawned by {targets} need to know which packages they need to load, which is way you should load the packages your pipeline needs using:\n\ntar_option_set(packages = \"dplyr\")"

    "text": "13.7 {targets} and RMarkdown (or Quarto)\nIt is also possible to compile documents using RMardown (or Quarto) with {targets}. The way this works is by setting up a pipeline that produces the outputs you need in the document, and then defining the document as a target to be computed as well. For example, if you’re showing a table in the document, create a target in the pipeline that builds the underlying data. Do the same for a plot, or a statistical model. Then, in the .Rmd (or .Qmd) source file, use targets::tar_read()to load the different objects you need.\nConsider the following _targets.R file:\n\nlibrary(targets)\n\ntar_option_set(packages = c(\"dplyr\", \"ggplot2\"))\n\nlist(\n  tar_target(\n    path_data_mtcars,\n    \"mtcars.csv\",\n    format = \"file\"\n  ),\n  tar_target(\n    data_mtcars,\n    read.csv(path_data_mtcars)\n  ),\n  tar_target(\n    summary_mtcars,\n    summary(data_mtcars)\n  ),\n  tar_target(\n    clean_mtcars,\n    mutate(data_mtcars,\n           am = as.character(am))\n  ),\n  tar_target(\n    plot_mtcars,\n    {ggplot(clean_mtcars) +\n       geom_point(aes(y = mpg,\n                      x = hp,\n                      shape = am))}\n  )\n)\n\nThis pipeline loads the .csv file from before and creates a summary of the data as well as plot. But we don’t simply want these objects to be saved as .rds files by the pipeline, we want to be able to use them to write a document (either in the .Rmd or .Qmd format). For this, we need another package, called {tarchetypes}. This package comes many functions that allow you to define new types of targets (these functions are called target factories in {targets} jargon). The new target factory that we need is tarchetypes::tar_render(). As you can probably guess from the name, this function renders an .Rmd file. Write the following lines in an .Rmd file and save it next to the pipeline:\n---\ntitle: \"mtcars is the best data set\"\nauthor: \"mtcars enjoyer\"\ndate: today\n---\n\n## Load the summary\n\n```{r, eval = FALSE}\ntar_read(summary_mtcars)\n```\nHere is the _targets.R file again, where I now load {tarchetypes} at the top and add a new target at the bottom:\n\nlibrary(targets)\nlibrary(tarchetypes)\n\ntar_option_set(packages = c(\"dplyr\", \"ggplot2\"))\n\nlist(\n  tar_target(\n    path_data_mtcars,\n    \"mtcars.csv\",\n    format = \"file\"\n  ),\n  tar_target(\n    data_mtcars,\n    read.csv(path_data_mtcars)\n  ),\n  tar_target(\n    summary_mtcars,\n    summary(data_mtcars)\n  ),\n  tar_target(\n    clean_mtcars,\n    mutate(data_mtcars,\n           am = as.character(am))\n  ),\n  tar_target(\n    plot_mtcars,\n    {ggplot(clean_mtcars) +\n       geom_point(aes(y = mpg,\n                      x = hp,\n                      shape = am))}\n  ),\n  tar_render(\n    my_doc,\n    \"my_document.Rmd\"\n  )\n)\n\nRunning this pipeline with targets::tar_make() will now compile the source .Rmd file into ar .html file that you can open in your web-browser. Even if you want to compile the document into another format, I advise you to develop using the .html format. This is because you can open the .html file in the web-browser, and keep working on the source. Each time you run the pipeline after you made some changes to the file, you simply need to refresh the web-browser to see your changes. If instead you compile a Word document, you will need to always close the file, and then re-open it to see your changes, which is quite annoying. A good second reason to have output in the .html format is that HTML is a text-only format, and thus can be tracked with version control systems covered in Chapter 5. The MS Word format is binary, and tracking it in Git is always an undecipherable mess. Keep in mind though that HTML files can get large, in which case you may want to not track the output .html.\nIf you open the output file, you should be seeing something quite plain looking:\n\n\n\nThe output of our pipeline. Our first data product!\n\n\nDon’t worry, we will make it look nice, but right at the end. Don’t waste time making things look good too early on. Ideally, try to get the pipeline to run on a simple example, and then keep adding features. Also, try to get as much feedback as possible on the content as early as possible from your colleagues. No point in wasting time to make something look good if what you’re writing is not at all what was expected. Let’s now get the ggplot of the data to show in the document as well.\nFor this, simply add:\ntar_read(plot_mtcars)\nat the bottom of the .Rmd file. Running the pipeline again will now add the plot to the document. Before continuing, let me just remind you, again, of the usefulness of {targets} by changing the underlying data. Run the following:\n\nwrite.csv(head(mtcars),\n          \"mtcars.csv\",\n          row.names = F)\n\nand run the pipeline again. Because the data changed and every target depends on the data, the document gets entirely rebuilt. I hope that you see why this is really great: in case you need to be build weekly, daily, heck, even hourly reports, by using {targets} the updated report can now get built automatically, and the targets that are not impacted by these recurrent updates will not need to be recomputed. Restore the data by running:\n\nwrite.csv(mtcars,\n          \"mtcars.csv\",\n          row.names = F)\n\nand rebuilding the document by running the pipeline.\nNow that the pipeline runs well, we can work a little on the document itself, by transforming the output into a nice looking table using {flextable}. But there is an issue however: the output of summary() on a data.frame object is not a data.frame, but a table andflextable::flextable() expects a data.frame. So if you call flextable::flextable() on the output of summary(), you’ll get an error message. Instead, we need a replacement for summary() that outputs a data.frame. This replacement is skimr::skim(); let’s go back to our pipeline and change the call to summary() to skim() (after adding the {skimr} to the list of loaded packages, as well as {flextable}):\nlibrary(targets)\nlibrary(tarchetypes)\n\ntar_option_set(packages = c(\n                 \"dplyr\",\n                 \"flextable\",\n                 \"ggplot2\",\n                 \"skimr\"\n                 )\n               )\n\nlist(\n  tar_target(\n    path_data_mtcars,\n    \"mtcars.csv\",\n    format = \"file\"\n  ),\n  tar_target(\n    data_mtcars,\n    read.csv(path_data_mtcars)\n  ),\n  tar_target(\n    summary_mtcars,\n    skim(data_mtcars)\n  ),\n  tar_target(\n    clean_mtcars,\n    mutate(data_mtcars,\n           am = as.character(am))\n  ),\n  tar_target(\n    plot_mtcars,\n    {ggplot(clean_mtcars) +\n       geom_point(aes(y = mpg,\n                      x = hp,\n                      shape = am))}\n  ),\n  tar_render(\n    my_doc,\n    \"my_document.Rmd\"\n  )\n)\nIn the .Rmd file, we can now pass the output of tar_read(summary_mtcars) to flextable():\n## Load the summary\n\n```{r}\ntar_read(summary_mtcars) %&gt;%\n  flextable()\n```\nIf you run the pipeline and look at the output now, you’ll see a nice table with a lot of summary statistics. Since the output of skim() is a data.frame, you can only keep the stats you want by dplyr::select()ing the columns you need:\n## Load the summary\n\n```{r}\ntar_read(summary_mtcars) %&gt;%\n  select(Variable = skim_variable,\n         Mean = numeric.mean,\n         SD = numeric.sd,\n         Histogram = numeric.hist) %&gt;%\n  flextable()\n```\nIf you want to hide all the R code in the output document, simply use knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = F) in the source .Rmd file, or if you want to hide the code from individual chunks use echo = FALSE in the chunks header. Here is what the final source code of the .Rmd could look like:\n---\ntitle: \"mtcars is the best data set\"\nauthor: \"mtcars enjoyer\"\ndate: today\n---\n\n```{r, include = FALSE}\n# Hides all source code\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = F)\n```\n\n\n## Load the summary statistics\n\nI really like to see the distribution of the\nvariables as a cell of a table:\n\n```{r}\ntar_read(summary_mtcars) %&gt;%\n  select(Variable = skim_variable,\n         Mean = numeric.mean,\n         SD = numeric.sd,\n         Histogram = numeric.hist) %&gt;%\n  flextable() %&gt;%\n  set_caption(\"Summary statistics for mtcars\")\n```\n\n\n## Graphics\n\nThe plot below is really nice, just look at it:\n\n```{r, fig.cap = \"Scatterplot of `mpg` and `hp` by type of transmission\"}\ntar_read(plot_mtcars) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n```\nAs you can see, once I’ve used targets::tar_read(), I get back the object just as if I had generated it from within the .Rmd source file, and can simply add stuff to it (like changing the theme of the ggplot). Once you’re happy with the contents, you can add output: word_document to the header of the document (just below date: today for example) to generate a Word document.\nLet me reiterate the advantages of using {targets} to compile RMarkdown documents: because the computation of all the objects is handled by {targets}, compiling the document itself is very quick. All that needs to happen is loading pre-computed targets. This also means that you benefit from all the other advantages of using {targets}: only the outdated targets get recomputed, and the computation of the targets can happen in parallel. Without {targets}, compiling the RMarkdown document would always recompute all the objects, and all the objects’ recomputation would happen sequentially."

    "text": "13.8 Rewriting our project as a pipeline and {renv} redux\nIt is now time to return our little project into a full-fledged reproducible pipeline. For this, we’re going back to our project’s folder and specifically to the fusen branch. This is the branch where we used {fusen} to turn our .Rmd into a package. This package contains the functions that we need to update the data. But remember, we wrote the analysis in another .Rmd file that we did not inflate, analyse_data.Rmd. We are now going to write a {targets} pipeline that will make use of the inflated package and compute all the targets required for the analysis. The first step is to create a new branch, but you could also create an entirely new repository if you want. It’s up to you. If you create a new branch, start from the rmd branch, since this will provide a nice starting point.\n#switch to the rmd branch\nowner@localhost ➤ git checkout rmd\n\n#create and switch to the new branch called pipeline\nowner@localhost ➤ git checkout -b pipeline \nIf you start with a fresh repository, you can grab the analyse_data.Rmd from here3.\nFirst order of business, let’s delete save_data.Rmd (unless you started with an empty repo). We don’t need that file anymore, since everything is now available in the package we developed:\nowner@localhost ➤ rm save_data.Rmd\nLet’s now start an R session in that folder and install our {housing} package. Whether you followed along and developed the package, or skipped the previous parts and didn’t develop the package by following along, install it from my Github repository. This ensures that you have exactly the same version as me. Run the following line:\n\nremotes::install_github(\"rap4all/housing@fusen\",\n                        ref = \"1c86095\")\n\nThis will install the package from my Github repository, and very specifically the version from the fusen branch at commit 1c86095 (you may need to install the {remotes} package first). Now that the package is installed, we can start building the pipeline. In the same R session, call targets::tar_script() which will give us a nice template _targets.R file:\n\ntargets::tar_script()\n\nYou should at most have three files: README.md, _targets.R and analyse_data.Rmd (unless you started with an empty repo, in which case you don’t have the README.md file). We will now change analyse_data.Rmd, to load pre-computed targets, instead of computing them inside the analyse_data.Rmd at compilation time.\nFirst, we need to load the data. The two datasets we use are now part of the package, so we can simply load them using data(commune_level_data) and data(country_level_data). But remember, {targets} only loves pure functions, and data() is not pure! Let’s see what happens when you call data(mtcars). If you’re using RStudio, this is really visible: in a fresh session, calling data(mtcars) shows the following in the Environment pane:\n\n\n\nWhat’s described as ‘mtcars’ is not a ‘data.frame’, yet.\n\n\nAt this stage, mtcars is only a promise. It’s only if you need to interact with mtcars that the promise becomes a data.frame. So data() returns a promise, does this mean that we can save that into a variable? If you try the following:\n\nx &lt;- data(mtcars)\n\nAnd check out x, you will see that x contains the string \"mtcars\" and is of class character! So data() returns a promise by saving it directly to the global environment (this is a side-effect) but it returns a string. Because {targets} needs pure functions, if we write:\n\ntar_target(\n  target_mtcars,\n  data(mtcars)\n)\n\nthe target_mtcars target will be equal to the \"mtcars\" character string. This might be confusing, but just remember: a target must return something, and functions with side-effects don’t always return something, or not the thing we want. Also remember the example on plotting with plot(), which does not return an object. It’s actually the same issue here.\nSo to solve this, we need a pure function that returns the data.frame. This means that it first needs to load the data, which results in a promise (which gets loaded into the environment directly), and then evaluate that promise. The function to achieve this is as follows:\n\nread_data &lt;- function(data_name, package_name){\n\n  temp &lt;- new.env(parent = emptyenv())\n\n  data(list = data_name,\n       package = package_name,\n       envir = temp)\n\n  get(data_name, envir = temp)\n}\n\nThis function takes data_name and package_name as arguments, both strings.\nThen, I used data() but with two arguments: list = and package =. list = is needed because we pass data_name as a string. If we did something like data(data_name) instead, hoping that data_name would get replaced by its bound value (\"commune_level_data\") it would result in an error. This is because data() would be looking for a data set literally called data_name instead of replacing data_name by its bound value. The second argument, package = simply states that we’re looking for that dataset in the {housing} package and uses the bound value of package_name. Now comes the envir = argument. This argument tells data() where to load the data set. By default, data() loads the data in the global environment. But remember, we want our function to be pure, meaning, it should only return the data object and not load anything into the global environment! So that’s where the temporary environment created in the first line of the body of the function comes into play. What happens is that the functions loads the data object into this temporary environment, which is different from the global environment. Once we’re done, we can simply discard this environment, and so our global environment stays clean.\nThe final step is using get(). Remember that once the line data(list = data_name...) has run, all we have is a promise. So if we stop there, the target would simply hold the character \"commune_level_data\". In order to turn that promise into the data frame, we use get(). We’ve already encountered this function in Chapter 7. get() searches an object by name, and returns it. So in the line get(data_name), data_name gets first replaced by its bound value, so get(\"commune_level_data\") and hence we get the dataset back. Also, get() looks for that name in the temporary environment that was set up. This way, there is literally no interaction with the global environment, so that function is pure: it always returns the same output for the same input, and does not pollute, in any way, the global environment. After that function is done running, the temporary environment is discarded.\nThis seems overly complicated, but it’s all a consequence of {targets} needing pure functions that actually return something to work well. Unfortunately some of R’s default functions are not pure, so we need this kind of workaround. However, all of this work is not in vain! By forcing us to use pure functions, {targets} contributes to the general quality and safety of our pipeline. Once our pipeline is done running, the global environment will stay clean. Having stuff pollute the global environment can cause interactions with subsequent runs of the pipeline.\nLet’s continue the pipeline: here is what it will ultimately look like:\n\nlibrary(targets)\nlibrary(tarchetypes)\n\ntar_option_set(packages = \"housing\")\n\nsource(\"functions/read_data.R\")\n\nlist(\n  tar_target(\n    commune_level_data,\n    read_data(\"commune_level_data\",\n              \"housing\")\n  ),\n\n  tar_target(\n    country_level_data,\n    read_data(\"country_level_data\",\n              \"housing\")\n  ),\n\n  tar_target(\n    commune_data,\n    get_laspeyeres(commune_level_data)\n  ),\n\n  tar_target(\n    country_data,\n    get_laspeyeres(country_level_data)\n  ),\n\n  tar_target(\n    communes,\n    c(\"Luxembourg\",\n      \"Esch-sur-Alzette\",\n      \"Mamer\",\n      \"Schengen\",\n      \"Wincrange\")\n  ),\n\n  tar_render(\n    analyse_data,\n    \"analyse_data.Rmd\"\n  )\n\n)\n\nAnd here is what analyse_data.Rmd now looks like:\n---\ntitle: \"Nominal house prices data in Luxembourg\"\nauthor: \"Bruno Rodrigues\"\ndate: \"`r Sys.Date()`\"\n---\n\nLet’s load the datasets (the Laspeyeres price index is already computed):\n\n```{r}\ntar_load(commune_data)\ntar_load(country_data)\n```\n\nWe are going to create a plot for 5 communes and compare the\nprice evolution in the communes to the national price evolution. \nLet’s first load the communes:\n\n```{r}\ntar_load(communes)\n```\n\n```{r, results = \"asis\"}\nres &lt;- lapply(communes, function(x){\n\n  knitr::knit_child(text = c(\n\n    '\\n',\n    '## Plot for commune: `r x`',\n    '\\n',\n    '```{r, echo = F}',\n    'print(make_plot(country_data, commune_data, x))',\n    '```'\n\n     ),\n     envir = environment(),\n     quiet = TRUE)\n\n})\n\ncat(unlist(res), sep = \"\\n\")\n\n```\nAs you can see, the data gets loaded by using targets::tar_load() which loads the two pre-computed data sets. The end portion of the document looks fairly similar to what we had before turning our analysis into a package and then a pipeline. We use a child document to generate as many sections as required automatically (remember, Don’t Repeat Yourself!). Try to change something in the pipeline, for example remove some communes from the communes object, and rerun the whole pipeline using tar_make().\nWe are now done with this introduction to {targets}: we have turned our analysis into a pipeline, and now we need to ensure that the outputs it produces are reproducible. So the first step is to use {renv}; but as already discussed, this will not be enough, but it is essential that you do it! So let’s initialize {renv}:\n\nrenv::init()\n\nThis will create an renv.lock file with all the dependencies of the pipeline listed. Very importantly, our Github package also gets listed:\n\"housing\": {\n  \"Package\": \"housing\",\n  \"Version\": \"0.1\",\n  \"Source\": \"GitHub\",\n  \"RemoteType\": \"github\",\n  \"RemoteHost\": \"api.github.com\",\n  \"RemoteRepo\": \"housing\",\n  \"RemoteUsername\": \"rap4all\",\n  \"RemoteRef\": \"fusen\",\n  \"RemoteSha\": \"1c860959310b80e67c41f7bbdc3e84cef00df18e\",\n  \"Hash\": \"859672476501daeea9b719b9218165f1\",\n  \"Requirements\": [\n    \"dplyr\",\n    \"ggplot2\",\n    \"janitor\",\n    \"purrr\",\n    \"readxl\",\n    \"rlang\",\n    \"rvest\",\n    \"stringr\",\n    \"tidyr\"\n  ]\n},\n\nIf you look at the fields titled RemoteSha and RemoteRef you should recognize the commit hash and repository that were used to install the package:\n\"RemoteRef\": \"fusen\",\n\"RemoteSha\": \"1c860959310b80e67c41f7bbdc3e84cef00df18e\",\nThis means that if someone wants to re-run our project, by running renv::restore() the correct version of the package will get installed! To finish things, we should edit the Readme.md file and add instructions on how to re-run the project. This is what the Readme.md file could look like:\n# How to run\n\n- Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:rap4all/housing.git`\n- Switch to the `pipeline` branch: `git checkout pipeline`\n- Start an R session in the folder and run `renv::restore()` \n   to install the project’s dependencies.\n- Run the pipeline with `targets::tar_make()`.\n- Checkout `analyse_data.html` for the output.\nIf you followed along, don’t forget to change the url of the repository to your own in the first bullet point of th Readme."

    "section": "13.9 Some little tips before concluding",
    "text": "13.9 Some little tips before concluding\nIn this section I’ll be showing you some other useful functions included in the {targets} package that I think you should know!\n\n13.9.1 Load every target at once\nIt is possible to load every target included in the cache at once using tar_load_everything(). But be careful, if your pipeline builds many targets, this can take some time!\n\n\n13.9.2 Get metadata information on your pipeline\ntar_meta() will return a data frame with some information about the pipeline. I find it quite useful after running the pipeline, and it turns out that some warnings or errors were raised. This is how this data frame looks like:\n\ntargets::tar_meta()\n\n# A tibble: 11 × 18\n   name       type  data  command depend [...]\n   &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;  [...]\n 1 analyse_d… stem  c251… 995812… 3233e… [...]\n 2 commune_d… stem  024d… 85c2ab… ec7f2… [...]\n 3 commune_l… stem  fb07… f48470… ce0d8… [...]\n 4 commune_l… stem  fb07… 2549df… 15e48… [...]\n 5 communes   stem  b097… be3c56… a3dad… [...]\n 6 country_d… stem  ae21… 9dc7a6… 1d321… [...]\nThere are more columns than those I’m showing, of great interest are the columns warnings and error. In the example below, I have changed the code to read_data(), and now it raises a warning:\n\ntargets::tar_make()\n\n• start target commune_level_data\n• built target commune_level_data [0.61 seconds]\n• start target country_level_data\n• built target country_level_data [0.02 seconds]\n✔ skip target communes\n✔ skip target commune_data\n✔ skip target country_data\n✔ skip target analyse_data\n• end pipeline [0.75 seconds]\nWarning messages:\n1: this is a warning \n2: this is a warning \n3: 2 targets produced warnings. Run tar_meta(fields = warnings, \n  complete_only = TRUE) for the messages. \n&gt; \nBecause warnings were raised, the pipeline raises another warning telling you to run tar_meta(fields = warnings, complete_only = TRUE) so let’s do it:\n\ntar_meta(fields = warnings, complete_only = TRUE)\n\nThis code returns a data frame with the name of the targets that produced the warning, alongside the warning.\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  name               warnings\n  &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;chr&gt;\n1 commune_level_data this is a warning\n2 country_level_data this is a warning\nSo now you can better see what is going on.\n\n\n13.9.3 Make a target (or the whole pipeline) outdated\nWith tar_invalidate() you can make a target outdated, so that when you rerun the pipeline, it gets re-computed (alongside every target that depends on it). This can sometimes be useful to make sure that everything is running correctly. Try running tar_invalidate(\"communes\") and see what happens. It is also possible to complete nuke the whole pipeline and rerun it from scratch using tar_destroy(). You’ll get asked to confirm if that’s what you want to do, and if yes, reruning the pipeline after that will start from scratch.\n\n\n13.9.4 Customize the network’s visualisation\nBy calling visNetwork::visNetworkEditor(tar_visnetwork()), a Shiny app gets started that lets you customize the look of your pipeline’s network. You can play around with the options and see the effect they have on the look of the network. It is also possible to generate R code that you can then paste into a script to consistently generate the same look.\n\n\n13.9.5 Use targets from one pipeline in another project\nIf you need to load some targets inside another project (for example, because you need to reference an older study), you can do so easily with {withr}:\n\nwithr::with_dir(\n  \"path/to/root/of/project\", \n  targets::tar_load(target_name))\n\n\n\n13.9.6 Understanding this cryptic error message\nSometimes, when you try to run the pipeline, you get the following error message:\nError:\n! Error running targets::tar_make()\n  Target errors: targets::tar_meta(fields = error, complete_only = TRUE)\n  Tips: https://books.ropensci.org/targets/debugging.html\n  Last error: argument 9 is empty\nThe last line is what interests us here: “Last error: argument 9 is empty”. It is not clear which target is raising this error: that’s because it’s not a target that is raising this error, but the pipeline itself! Remember that the pipeline is nothing but a list of targets. If your last target ends with a , character, list() is expecting another element. But because there’s none, this error gets raised. Type list(1,2,) in the console and you will get the same error message. Simply check your last target, there is a , in there that you should remove!"

    "section": "14.1 What is Docker?",
    "text": "14.1 What is Docker?\nLet me first explain in very simple terms what Docker is.\nIn very simple (and technically wrong) terms, Docker makes it easy to run a Linux virtual machine (VM) on your computer. A VM is a computer within a computer: the idea is that you turn on your computer, start Windows (the operating system you use every day), but then start Ubuntu (a very popular Linux distribution) as if it were any other app installed on your computer and use it (almost) as you would normally. This is what a classic VM solution like Virtualbox offers you. You can start and use Ubuntu interactively from within Windows. This can be quite useful for testing purposes for example.\nThe way Docker differs from Virtualbox (or VMware) is that it strips down the VM to its bare essentials. There’s no graphical user interface for example, and you will not (typically) use a Docker VM interactively. What you will do instead is write down in a text file the specifications of the VM you want. Let’s call this text file a Dockerfile. For example, you want the VM to be based on Ubuntu. So that would be the first line in the Dockerfile. You then want it to have R installed. So that would be the second line. Then you need to install R packages, so you add those lines as well. Maybe you need to add some system dependencies? Add them. Finally, you add the code of the pipeline that you want to make reproducible as well.\nOnce you’re done, you have this text file, the Dockerfile, with a complete recipe to generate a Docker VM. That VM is called an image (as I said previously it’s technically not a true VM, but let’s not discuss this). So you have a text file, and this file helps you define and generate an image. Here, you should already see a first advantage of using Docker over a more traditional VM solution like Virtualbox: you can very easily write these Dockerfiles and version them. You can easily start off from another Dockerfile from another project and adapt it to your current pipeline. And most importantly, because everything is written down, it’s reproducible (but more on that at the end of this chapter…).\nOk, so you have this image. This image will be based on some Linux distribution, very often Ubuntu. It comes with a specific version of Ubuntu, and you can add to it a specific version of R. You can also download a specific version of all the packages required for your pipeline. You end up with an environment that is tailor-made for your pipeline. You can then run the pipeline with this Docker image, and always get exactly the same results, ever. This is because, regardless of how, where or when you will run this dockerized pipeline, the same version of R, with the same version of R packages, on the same Linux distribution will be used to reproduce the results of your pipeline. By the way, when you run a Docker image, as in, you’re executing your pipeline inside that container, this now is referred to as a Docker container.\nSo: a Dockerfile defines a Docker image, from which you can then run containers. I hope that the pictures below will help. The first picture shows what happens when you run the same pipeline on two different R versions and two different operating systems:\n\n\n\nRunning a pipeline without Docker results (potentially) in different outputs.\n\n\nTake a close look at the output, you will notice it’s different!\nNow, you run the same pipeline, which is now dockerized:\n\n\n\nRunning a pipeline with Docker results in the same outputs.\n\n\nAnother way of looking at a Docker image: it’s an immutable sandbox, where the rules of the game are always the same. It doesn’t matter where or when you run this sandbox, the pipeline will always be executed in this same, well-defined space. Because the pipeline runs on the same versions of R (and packages) and on the same operating system defined within the Docker image, our pipeline is now truly reproducible.\nBut why Linux though; why isn’t it possible to create Docker images based on Windows or macOS? Remember in the introduction, where I explained what reproducibility is? I wrote:\n\nOpen source is a hard requirement for reproducibility.\n\nOpen source is not just a requirement for the programming language used for building the pipeline but extends to the operating system that the pipeline runs on as well. So the reason Docker uses Linux is because you can use Linux distributions like Ubuntu for free and without restrictions. There aren’t any licenses that you need to buy or activate, and Linux distributions can be customized for any use case imaginable. Thus Linux distributions are the only option available to Docker for this task."

    "text": "14.2 A primer on Linux\nUp until this point, you could have followed along using any operating system. Most of the code shown in this book is R code, so it doesn’t matter on what operating system you’re running it. But there was some code that I ran in the Linux console (for example, I’ve used ls to list files). These commands should also work on macOS, and some even on Windows (ls also works on the Windows command prompt, and in Powershell as well). Instead of using the command line, you could have followed along using the user interface of your operating system as well. For example, in Chapter 11, I list the contents of the dev/ directory using the following command:\nowner@localhost ➤ ls dev/\nbut you could have just opened the dev/ folder in the file explorer of your operating system of choice. But to use Docker, you will need to get to know Linux and the Linux ecosystem and concepts a little bit. No worries, it’s not as difficult as it sounds, and I think that you likely aren’t afraid of difficult things, or else you would have stopped reading this book much earlier.\nLinux is not the name of any one specific operating system, but of an operating system kernel. A kernel is an important component of an operating system. What sets the Linux kernel apart from the one used for Windows or macOS, is that the Linux kernel is open-source and free software. So anyone can take that kernel, and add all the other components needed to build a complete operating system. This is why there are many Linux distributions: a Linux distribution is a complete operating system that uses Linux as its kernel. The most popular Linux distribution is called Ubuntu, and if one time you googled something along the lines of “easy linux os for beginners” the answer that came out on top was likely Ubuntu, or one of the other variants of Ubuntu (yes, because Ubuntu itself is also open-source and free software, it is possible to build a variant using Ubuntu as a basis, like Linux Mint).\nTo define our Docker images, we will be using Ubuntu as a base. The Ubuntu operating system has two releases a year, one in April and one in October. On even years, the April release is long-term support (LTS) release. LTS releases get security updates for 5 years, and Docker images generally use an LTS release as a base. As of writing (May 2023), the current LTS is Ubuntu 22.04 Jammy Jellyfish (Ubuntu releases are named with a number of the form YY.MM and then a code name based on some animal).\nIf you want, you can install Ubuntu on your computer. But there’s no need for this, since you can use Docker to ship your projects!\nA major difference between Ubuntu (and other Linux distributions) and macOS and Windows is how you install software. In short, software for Linux distributions is distributed as packages. If you want to install, say, the Emacs text editor, you can run the following command in the terminal:\nsudo apt-get install emacs-gtk\nLet’s break this down: sudo makes the next commands run as root. root is Linux jargon for the administrator account. So if I type sudo xyz, the command xyz will run with administrator privileges. Then comes apt-get install. apt-get is Ubuntu’s package manager, and install is the command that installs emacs-gtk. emacs-gtk is the name of the Emacs package. Because you’re an R user, this should be somewhat familiar: after all, extensions for R are also installed using a package manager and a command: install.packages(\"package_name\"). Just like in R, where the packages get downloaded from CRAN, Ubuntu downloads packages from a repository which you can browse here. Of course, because using the command line is intimidating for beginners, it is also possible to install packages using a software store, just like on macOS or Windows. But remember, Docker only uses what it absolutely needs to function, so there’s no interactive user interface. This is not because Docker’s developers don’t like user interfaces, but because the point of Docker is not to use Docker images interactively, so there’s no need for the user interface. So you need to know how to install Ubuntu packages with the command line.\nJust like for R, it is possible to install software from different sources. It is possible to add different repositories, and install software from there. We are not going to use this here, but just as an aside, if you are using Ubuntu on your computer as your daily driver operating system, you really should check out r2u, an Ubuntu repository that comes with pre-compiled R packages that can get installed, very, very quickly. Even though we will not be using this here (and I’ll explain why later in this chapter), you should definitely consider r2u to provide binary R packages if you use Ubuntu as your daily operating system.\nLet’s suppose that you are using Ubuntu on your machine, and are using R. If you want to install the {dplyr} R package, something interesting happens when you type:\n\ninstall.packages(\"dplyr\")\n\nOn Windows and macOS, a compiled binary gets downloaded from CRAN and installed on your computer. A “binary” is the compiled source code of the package. Many R packages come with C++ or Fortran code, and this code cannot be used as is by R. So these bits of C++ and Fortran code need to be compiled to be used. Think of it this way: if the source code is the ingredients of a recipe, the compiled binary is the cooked meal. Now imagine that each time you want to eat Bouillabaisse, you have to cook it yourself… or you could get it delivered to your home. You’d probably go for the delivery (especially if it would be free) instead of cooking it each time. But this supposes that there are people out there cooking Bouillabaisse for you. CRAN essentially cooks the package source codes into binaries for Windows and macOS, as shown below:\n\n\n\nDownload links to pre-compiled tidyverse binaries.\n\n\nIn the image above, you can see links to compiled binaries of the {tidyverse} package for Windows and macOS, but none for any Linux distribution. This is because, as stated in the introduction, there are many, many, many Linux distributions. So at best, CRAN could offer binaries for Ubuntu, but Ubuntu is not the only Linux distribution, and Ubuntu has two releases a year, which means that every CRAN package (that needs compilation) would need to get compiled twice a year. This is a huge undertaking unless CRAN decided to only offer binaries for LTS releases. But that would still be every two years.\nSo instead, what happens, is that the burden of compilation is pushed to the user. Every time you type install.packages(\"package_name\"), and if that package requires compilation, that package gets compiled on your machine which not only takes some time, but can also fail. This is because very often, R packages that require compilation need some additional system-level dependencies that need to be installed. For example, here are the Ubuntu dependencies that need to be installed for the installation of the {tidyverse} package to succeed:\nlibicu-dev\nzlib1g-dev\nmake\nlibcurl4-openssl-dev\nlibssl-dev\nlibfontconfig1-dev\nlibfreetype6-dev\nlibfribidi-dev\nlibharfbuzz-dev\nlibjpeg-dev\nlibpng-dev\nlibtiff-dev\npandoc\nlibxml2-dev\nThis why r2u is so useful: by adding this repository, what you’re essentially doing is telling R to not fetch the packages from CRAN, but from the r2u repository. And this repository contains compiled R packages for Ubuntu. So the required system-level dependencies get installed automatically and the R package doesn’t need compilation. So installation of the {tidyverse} package takes less than half a minute on a modern machine.\nBut if r2u is so nice, why did I say above that we would not be using it? Unfortunately, this is because r2u does not archive compiled binaries of older packages, and this is exactly what we need for reproducibility. So when you’re building a Docker image to make a project reproducible, because that image will be based on Ubuntu, we will need to make sure that our Docker image contains the right system-level dependencies so that compilation of the R packages doesn’t fail. Thankfully, you’re reading the right book."

    "section": "14.3 First steps with Docker",
    "text": "14.3 First steps with Docker\nLet’s start by creating a “Hello World” Docker image. As I explained in the beginning, to define a Docker image, we need to create a Dockerfile with some instructions. But first, you need of course to install Docker. To install Docker on any operating system (Windows, macOS or Ubuntu or other Linuxes), you can install Docker Desktop. If you’re running Ubuntu (or another Linux distribution) and don’t want the GUI, you could install the Docker engine and then follow the post-installation steps for Linux instead.\nIn any case, whatever operating system you’re using, we will be using the command line to interact with Docker. Once you’re done with installing Docker, create a folder somewhere on your computer, and create inside of this folder an empty text file with the name “Dockerfile”. This can be tricky on Windows, because you have to remove the .txt extension that gets added by default. You might need to turn on the option “File name extensions” in the View pane of the Windows file explorer to make this process easier. Then, open this file with your favourite text editor, and add the following lines:\nFROM ubuntu:jammy\n\nRUN uname -a\nThis very simple Dockerfile does two things: it starts by stating that it’s based on the Ubuntu Jammy (so version 22.04) operating system, and then runs the uname -a command. This command, which gets run inside the Ubunu command line, prints the Linux kernel version from that particular Ubuntu release. FROM and RUN are Docker commands; there are a couple of others that we will discover a bit later. Now, what do you do with this Dockerfile? Remember, a Dockerfile defines an image. So now, we need to build this image to run a container. Open a terminal/command prompt in the folder where the Dockerfile is and type the following:\nowner@localhost ➤ docker build -t raps_hello .\nThe docker build command builds an image from the Dockerfile that is in the path . (a single . means “this current working directory”). The -t option tags that image with the name raps_hello. If everything goes well, you should see this output:\nSending build context to Docker daemon  2.048kB\nStep 1/2 : FROM ubuntu:jammy\n ---&gt; 08d22c0ceb15\nStep 2/2 : RUN uname -a\n ---&gt; Running in 697194b9a519\nLinux 697194b9a519 6.2.6-1-default #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC \n     Mon Mar 13 18:57:27 UTC 2023 (fa1a4c6) x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\nRemoving intermediate container 697194b9a519\n ---&gt; a0ea59f23d01\nSuccessfully built a0ea59f23d01\nSuccessfully tagged raps_hello:latest\nLook at Step 2/2: you should see the output of the uname -a command:\nLinux 697194b9a519 6.2.6-1-default #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC\n     Mon Mar 13 18:57:27 UTC 2023 (fa1a4c6) x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\nEvery RUN statement in the Dockerfile gets executed at build time: so this is what we will use to install R and needed packages. This way, once the image is built, we end up with an image that contains all the software we need.\nNow, we would like to be able to use this image. Using a built image, we can start one or several containers that we can use for whatever we want. Let’s now create a more realistic example. Let’s build a Docker image that comes with R pre-installed. But for this, we need to go back to our Dockerfile and change it a bit:\nFROM ubuntu:jammy\n\nENV TZ=Europe/Luxembourg\n\nRUN ln -snf /usr/share/zoneinfo/$TZ /etc/localtime && echo $TZ &gt; /etc/timezone\n\nRUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y r-base\n\nCMD [\"R\"]\nFirst we define a variable using ENV, called TZ and we set that to the Europe/Luxembourg time zone (you can change this to your own time zone). We then run a rather complex looking command that sets the defined time zone system-wide. We had to do all this, because when we will later install R, a system-level dependency called tzdata gets installed alongside it. This tool then asks the user to enter his or her time zone interactively. But we cannot interact with the image interactively as it’s being built, so the build process gets stuck at this prompt. By using these two commands, we can set the correct time zone and once tzdata gets installed, that tool doesn’t ask for the time zone anymore, so the build process can continue. This is a rather known issue when building Docker images based on Ubuntu, so the fix is easily found with a Google search (but I’m giving it to you, dear reader, for free).\nThen come RUN statements. The first one uses Ubuntu’s package manager to first refresh the repositories (this ensures that our local Ubuntu installation repositories are in synch with the latest software updates that were pushed to the central Ubuntu repos). Then we use Ubuntu’s package manager to install r-base. r-base is the package that installs R. We then finish this Dockerfile by running CMD [\"R\"]. This is the command that will be executed when we run the container. Remember: RUN commands get executed at build-time, CMD commands at run-time. This distinction will be important later on.\nLet’s build the image (this will take some time, because a lot of software gets installed):\nowner@localhost ➤ docker build -t raps_ubuntu_r .\nThis builds an image called raps_ubuntu_r. This image is based on Ubuntu 22.04 Jammy Jellyfish and comes with R pre-installed. But the version of R that gets installed is the one made available through the Ubuntu repositories, and as of writing that is version 4.1.2, while the latest version available is R version 4.2.3. So the version available through the Ubuntu repositories lags behind the actual release. But no matter, we will deal with that later.\nWe can now start a container with the following command:\nowner@localhost ➤ docker run raps_ubuntu_r\nAnd this is the output we get:\nFatal error: you must specify '--save', '--no-save' or '--vanilla'\nWhat is going on here? When you run a container, the command specified by CMD gets executed, and then the container quits. So here, the container ran the command R, which started the R interpreter, but then quit immediately. When quitting R, users should specify if they want to save or not save the workspace. This is what the message above is telling us. So, how can be use this? Is there a way to use this R version interactively?\nYes, there is a way to use this R version boxed inside our Docker image interactively, even though that’s not really what we want to achieve. What we want instead is that our pipeline gets executed when we run the container. We don’t want to mess with the container interactively. But let me show you how we can interact with this dockerized R version. First, you need to let the container run in the background. You can achieve this by running the following command:\nowner@localhost ➤ docker run -d -it --name ubuntu_r_1 raps_ubuntu_r\nThis runs the container that we name “ubuntu_r_1” from the image “raps_ubuntu_r” (remember that we can run many containers from one single image definition). Thanks to the option -d, the container runs in the background, and the option -it states that we want an interactive shell to be waiting for us. So the container runs in the background, with an interactive shell waiting for us, instead of launching (and then immediately stopping) the R command. You can now “connect” to the interactive shell and start R in it using:\nowner@localhost ➤ docker exec -it ubuntu_r_1 R\nYou should now see the familiar R prompt:\nR version 4.1.2 (2021-11-01) -- \"Bird Hippie\"\nCopyright (C) 2021 The R Foundation for Statistical Computing\nPlatform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit)\n\nR is free software and comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.\nYou are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions.\nType 'license()' or 'licence()' for distribution details.\n\nR is a collaborative project with many contributors.\nType 'contributors()' for more information and\n'citation()' on how to cite R or R packages in publications.\n\nType 'demo()' for some demos, 'help()' for on-line help, or\n'help.start()' for an HTML browser interface to help.\nType 'q()' to quit R.\n\n&gt; \nWelcome to a dockerized version of R. Now, all of this might have felt overly complicated to you. And of course if this is the first time that you have played around with Docker, it is tricky indeed. However, you shouldn’t worry too much about it, for several reasons:\n\nwe are not going to use Docker containers interactively, that’s not really the point, but it can be useful to log in into the running container to check if things are working as expected;\nwe will build our images on top of pre-built images from the Rocker project1 and these images come with a lot of software pre-installed and configuration taken care of.\n\nWhat you should take away from this section is that you need to write a Dockerfile which then allows you to build an image. This image can then be used to run one (or several) containers. These containers, at run-time, will execute our pipeline in an environment that is frozen, such that the output of this run will stay constant, forever."

    "text": "14.4 The Rocker project\nThe Rocker project offers a very large collection of “R-ready” Docker images that you can use as starting points for building your own Docker images. Before using these images though, I still need to explain one very important Docker concept. Let’s go back to our “Hello World” Docker image:\nFROM ubuntu:jammy\n\nRUN uname -a\nThe very first line, FROM ubuntu:jammy downloads an Ubuntu Jammy image, but from where? All these images get downloaded from Docker Hub, which you can browse here2. If you create an account you can even push your own images on there. For example, we could push the image we built before, which we called raps_ubuntu_r, on Docker Hub. Then, if we wanted to create a new Docker image that builds upon raps_ubuntu_r we could simply type FROM username:raps_ubuntu_r (or something similar).\nIt’s also possible to not use Docker Hub at all, and share the image you built as a file. I’ll explain how later.\nThe Rocker project offers many different images, which are described here3. We are going to be using the versioned images. These are images that ship specific versions of R. This way, it doesn’t matter when the image gets build, the same version of R will be installed by getting built from source. Let me explain why building R from source is important. When we build the image from the Dockerfile we wrote before, R gets installed from the Ubuntu repositories. For this we use Ubuntu’s package manager and the following command: apt-get install -y r-base. As of writing, the version of R that gets installed is version 4.1.3. There’s two problems with installing R from Ubuntu’s repositories. First, we have to use whatever gets installed, which can be a problem with reproducibility. If we ran our analysis using R version 4.2.1, then we would like to dockerize that version of R. The second problem is that when we build the image today we get version 4.1.3. But it is not impossible that if we build the image in 6 months, we get R version 4.2.0, because it is likely that the version that ships in Ubuntu’s repositories will get updated at some point.\nThis means that depending on when we build the Docker image, we might get a different version of R. There are only two ways of avoiding this problem: either we build the image once and archive it and make sure to always keep a copy and ship that copy forever (or for as long as we want to make sure that pipeline is reproducible) just as you would ship data, code and any documentation required to make the pipeline reproducible. Or we write the Dockerfile in such a way that it always produces the same image, regardless of when it gets built. I very strongly advise you to go for the second option, but to also archive the image. But of course, this also depends on how critical your project is. Maybe you don’t need to start archiving images, or maybe you don’t even need to make sure that the Dockerfile always produces the same image. But I would still highly recommend that you write your Dockerfiles in such a way that they always output the same image. It is safer, and it doesn’t really mean extra work, thanks to the Rocker project.\nSo, let’s go back to the Rocker project, and specifically their versioned images which you can find here4. When you use one of the versioned images as a base for your project, you get the following guarantees:\n\na fixed version of R that gets built from source. It doesn’t matter when you build the image, it will always ship with the same version of R;\nthe operating system will be the LTS release that was current when that specific version of R was current;\nthe R repositories are set to the Posit Public Package Manager (PPPM) at a specific date. This ensures that R packages don’t need to be compiled as PPPM serves binary packages for the amd64 architecture (which is the architecture that virtually all non-Apple computers use these days).\n\nThis last point requires some more explanations. You should know that versioned Rocker images use the PPPM set at a specific date. This is a very neat feature of the PPPM. For example, the versioned Rocker image that comes with R 4.2.2 has the repos set at the 14th of March 2023, as you can see for yourself here5. This means that if you use install.packages(\"dplyr\") inside a container running from that image, then the version of {dplyr} that will get installed is the one that was available on the 14th of March.\nThis can be convenient in certain situations, and you may want, depending on your needs, to use the PPPM set a specific date to define Docker images, as the Rocker project does. You could even set the PPPM at a specific date for your main development machine (just follow the instructions here6). But keep in mind that you will not be getting any updates to packages, so if you want to install a fresh version of a package that may introduce some nice new features, you’ll need to change the repos again. This is why I highly advise you to stay with your default repositories (or use r2u if you are on Ubuntu) and manage your projects’ package libraries using {renv}. This way, you don’t have to mess with anything, and have the flexibility to have a separate package library per project. The other added benefit is that you can then use the project’s renv.lock file to install the exact same package library inside the Docker image.\nAs a quick introduction to using Rocker images, let’s grab our pipeline’s renv.lock file which you can download from here7. This is the latest renv.lock file that we generated for our pipeline, it contains all the needed packages to run our pipeline, including the right versions of the {targets} package and the {housing} package that we developed. An important remark: it doesn’t matter if the renv.lock file contains packages that were released after the 14th of March. Even if the repositories inside the Rocker image that we will be using are set to that date, the lock file also specifies the URL of the right repository to download the packages from. So that URL will be used instead of the one defined for the Rocker image.\nAnother useful aspect of the renv.lock file is that it also records the R version that was used to originally develop the pipeline, in this case, R version 4.2.2. So that’s the version we will be using in our Dockerfile. Next, we need to check the version of {renv} that we used to build the renv.lock file. You don’t necessarily need to install the same version, but I recommend you do. For example, as I’m writing these lines, {renv} version 0.17.1 is available, but the renv.lock file was written by {renv} version 0.16.0. So to avoid any compatibility issues, we will also install the exact same version. Thankfully, that is quite easy to do (to check the version of {renv} that was used to write the lock file simply look for the word “renv” in the lock file).\nWhile {renv} takes care of installing the right R packages, it doesn’t take care of installing the right system-level dependencies. So that’s why we need to install these system-level dependencies ourselves. I will give you a list of system-level dependencies that you can install to avoid any issues below, and I will also explain to you how I was able to come up with this list. It is quite easy thanks to Posit and their PPPM. For example, here8 is the summary page for the {tidyverse} package. If you select “Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy)” on the top right, and then scroll down, you will see a list of dependencies that you can simply copy and paste into your Dockerfile:\n\n\n\nSystem-level dependencies for the {tidyverse} package on Ubuntu.\n\n\nWe will use this list to install the required dependencies for our pipeline.\nCreate a new folder and call it whatever you want and save the renv.lock file linked above inside of it. Then, create an empty text file and call it Dockerfile. Add the following lines:\nFROM rocker/r-ver:4.2.2\n\nRUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \\\n    libglpk-dev \\\n    libxml2-dev \\\n    libcairo2-dev \\\n    libgit2-dev \\\n    default-libmysqlclient-dev \\\n    libpq-dev \\\n    libsasl2-dev \\\n    libsqlite3-dev \\\n    libssh2-1-dev \\\n    libxtst6 \\\n    libcurl4-openssl-dev \\\n    libharfbuzz-dev \\\n    libfribidi-dev \\\n    libfreetype6-dev \\\n    libpng-dev \\\n    libtiff5-dev \\\n    libjpeg-dev \\\n    libxt-dev \\\n    unixodbc-dev \\\n    wget \\\n    pandoc\n\nRUN R -e \"install.packages('remotes')\"\n\nRUN R -e \"remotes::install_github('rstudio/renv@0.16.0')\"\n\nRUN mkdir /home/housing\n\nCOPY renv.lock /home/housing/renv.lock\n\nRUN R -e \"setwd('/home/housing');renv::init();renv::restore()\"\nThe first line states that we will be basing our image on the image from the Rocker project that ships with R version 4.2.2, which is the right version that we need. Then, we install the required system-level dependencies using Ubuntu’s package manager, as previously explained. Then comes the {remotes} package. This will allow us to download a specific version from {renv} from Github, which is what we do in the next line. I want to stress again that I do this simply because the original renv.lock file was generated using {renv} version 0.16.0 and so to avoid any potential compatibility issues, I also use this one to restore the required packages for the pipeline. But it is very likely that I could have installed the current version of {renv} to restore the packages, and that it would have worked without problems. But just to be on the safe side, I install the right version of {renv}. By the way, I knew how to do this because I read this vignette9 that explains all these steps (but I’ve only kept the absolute essential lines of code to make it work). Next comes the line RUN mkdir /home/housing, which creates a folder (mkdir stands for make directory), inside the Docker image, in /home/housing. On Linux distributions, /home/ is the directory that users use to store their files, so I create the /home/ folder and inside of it, I create a new folder, housing which will contain the files for my project. It doesn’t really matter if you keep that structure or not, you could skip the /home/ folder if you wanted. What matters is that you put the files where you can find them.\nNext comes COPY renv.lock /home/housing/renv.lock. This copies the renv.lock file from our computer (remember, I told you to save this file next to the Dockerfile) to /home/housing/renv.lock. By doing this, we include the renv.lock file inside of the Docker image which will be crucial for the next and final step: RUN R -e \"setwd('/home/housing');renv::init();renv::restore()\".\nThis runs the R program from the Linux command line with the option -e. This option allows you to pass an R expression to the command line, which needs to be written between \"\". Using R -e will quickly become an habit, because this is how you can run R non-interactively, from the command line. The expression we pass sets the working directory to /home/housing, and then we use renv::init() and renv::restore() to restore the packages from the renv.lock file that we copied before. Using this Dockerfile, we can now build an image that will come with R version 4.2.2 pre-installed as well as all the same packages that we used to develop the housing pipeline.\nBuild the image using docker build -t housing_image . (don’t forget the . at the end).\nThe build process will take some time, so I would advise you to go get a hot beverage in the meantime. Now, we did half the work: we have an environment that contains the required software for our pipeline, but the pipeline files themselves are missing. But before adding the pipeline itself, let’s see if the Docker image we built is working. For this, log in to a command line inside a running Docker container started from this image with this single command:\ndocker run --rm -it --name housing_container housing_image bash\nThis starts bash (Ubuntu’s command line) inside the housing_container that gets started from the housing_image image. We add the --rm flag do docker run, this way the Docker container gets stopped when we log out (if not, then the Docker container will continue running in the background). Once logged in, we can move to the folder’s project using:\nuser@docker ➤ cd home/housing\nand then start the R interpreter:\nuser@docker ➤ R\nif everything goes well, you should see the familiar R prompt with a message from {renv} at the end:\nR version 4.2.2 (2022-10-31) -- \"Innocent and Trusting\"\nCopyright (C) 2022 The R Foundation for Statistical Computing\nPlatform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit)\n\nR is free software and comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.\nYou are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions.\nType 'license()' or 'licence()' for distribution details.\n\n  Natural language support but running in an English locale\n\nR is a collaborative project with many contributors.\nType 'contributors()' for more information and\n'citation()' on how to cite R or R packages in publications.\n\nType 'demo()' for some demos, 'help()' for on-line help, or\n'help.start()' for an HTML browser interface to help.\nType 'q()' to quit R.\n\n* Project '/home/housing' loaded.

    "section": "14.5 Dockerizing projects",
    "text": "14.5 Dockerizing projects\nSo we now have a Docker image that has the right environment for our project. We can now dockerize the project itself. There are two ways to do this: we either simply add the required lines to our Dockerfile, meaning copying the _targets.R script to the Docker image at build time and then use targets::tar_make() to run the pipeline, or we now create a new Dockerfile that will build upon this image and add the required lines there. In this section, we will use the first approach, and in the next section, we will use the second. The advantage of the first approach is that we have a single Dockerfile, and everything we need is right there. Also, each Docker image is completely tailor-made for each project. The issue is that building takes some time, so if for every project we restart from scratch it can be tedious to have to wait for the build process to be done (especially if you use continuous integration, as we shall see in the next chapter).\nThe advantage of the second approach is that we have a base that we can keep using for as long as we want. You will only need to wait once for R and the required packages to get installed. Then, you can use this base for any project that requires the same version of R and packages. This is especially useful if you don’t update your development environment very often, and develop a lot of projects with it.\nIn summary, the first approach is “dockerize pipelines”, and the second approach is “dockerize the dev environment and use it for many pipelines”. It all depends on how you work: in research, you might want to go for the first approach, as each project likely depends on bleeding-edge versions of R and packages. But in industry, where people tend to put the old adage “if ain’t broke don’t fix it” into practice, dev environments are usually frozen for some time and only get updated when really necessary (or according to a fixed schedule).\nTo dockerize the pipeline, we first need to understand something important with Docker, which I’ve already mentioned in passing: a Docker image is an immutable sandbox. This means that we cannot change it at run-time, only at build-time. So if we log in to a running Docker container (as we did before), and install an R package using install.packages(\"package_name\"), that package will disappear if we stop that container. The same is true for any files that get created at run-time: they will also disappear once the container is stopped. So how are we supposed to get the outputs that our pipeline generates from the Docker container? For this, we need to create a volume. A volume is nothing more than a shared folder between the Docker container and the host machine that starts the container. We simply need to specify the path for this shared folder when running the container, and that’s it.\nLet’s first write a Dockerfile that contains all the necessary files. We simply need to add the _targets.R script from our pipeline, the analyse_data.Rmd markdown file and all the functions from the functions/ folder (you can find all the required files here10):\nFROM rocker/r-ver:4.2.2\n\nRUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \\\n    libglpk-dev \\\n    libxml2-dev \\\n    libcairo2-dev \\\n    libgit2-dev \\\n    default-libmysqlclient-dev \\\n    libpq-dev \\\n    libsasl2-dev \\\n    libsqlite3-dev \\\n    libssh2-1-dev \\\n    libxtst6 \\\n    libcurl4-openssl-dev \\\n    libharfbuzz-dev \\\n    libfribidi-dev \\\n    libfreetype6-dev \\\n    libpng-dev \\\n    libtiff5-dev \\\n    libjpeg-dev \\\n    libxt-dev \\\n    unixodbc-dev \\\n    wget \\\n    pandoc\n\nRUN R -e \"install.packages('remotes')\"\n\nRUN R -e \"remotes::install_github('rstudio/renv@0.16.0')\"\n\nRUN mkdir /home/housing\n\nRUN mkdir /home/housing/pipeline_output\n\nRUN mkdir /home/housing/shared_folder\n\nCOPY renv.lock /home/housing/renv.lock\n\nCOPY functions /home/housing/functions\n\nCOPY analyse_data.Rmd /home/housing/analyse_data.Rmd\n\nCOPY _targets.R /home/housing/_targets.R\n\nRUN R -e \"setwd('/home/housing');renv::init();renv::restore()\"\n\nRUN cd /home/housing && R -e \"targets::tar_make()\"\n\nCMD mv /home/housing/pipeline_output/* /home/housing/shared_folder/\nI’ve added some COPY statements to copy the files from our computer to the Docker image, and also created some new directories: the pipeline_output and the shared_folder directories. pipeline_output is the folder that will contain all the outputs from the pipeline, and shared_folder (you guessed it) will be the folder that we will use to save the outputs of the pipeline to our computer.\nI then use targets::tar_make() to run the pipeline, but I first need to use cd /home/housing to change directories to the project’s folder. This is because in order to use the library that {renv} installed, we need to start the R session in the right directory. So we move to the right directory, then we run the pipeline using R -e \"targets::tar_make()\". Notice that we do both operations within a RUN statement. This means that the pipeline will run at build-time (remember, RUN statements run at build-time, CMD statements at run-time). In order words, the image will contain the outputs. This way, if the build process and the pipeline take a long time to run, you can simply leave them running overnight for example. In the morning, while sipping on your coffee, you can then simply run the container to instantly get the outputs. This is because we move the outputs of the pipeline from the folder pipeline_output to the shared_folder folder using a CMD statament. Thus, when we run the container, the outputs get moved into the shared folder, and we can retrieve them.\nOne last thing I had to do: I needed to change the last target in the _targets.R script. Before dockerizing it, it was like this:\n\ntar_render(\n  analyse_data,\n  \"analyse_data.Rmd\"\n)\n\nbut I had to change it to this:\n\ntar_render(\n  analyse_data,\n  \"analyse_data.Rmd\",\n  output_dir = \"/home/housing/pipeline_output\"\n)\n\nThe argument to output_dir gets passed to knitr::knit() and simply states that the output files should be saved in that folder. I can now build the image using docker build -t housing_image .. Once the build process is done, we can log in to the container to see if our files are there. But let me repeat again, that you are not really supposed to do so. You could simply run the container now and get your files. But let’s just take a quick look. You can log in to a bash session using:\nowner@localhost ➤ docker run --rm -it --name housing_container housing_image bash\nIf you then move to /home/housing/pipeline_output and run ls in that folder, you should see analyse_data.html. That’s our output! So how do we get it out?\nYou need to run the container with the -v flag which allows you to specify the path to the shared folder on your computer, and the shared folder inside the Docker container. The code below shows how to do it (I’ve used the \\ to break this long command over two lines):\nowner@localhost ➤ docker run --rm --name housing_container -v \\\n                  /host/path/to/shared_folder:/home/housing/shared_folder:rw \\\n                  housing_image\n/host/path/to/shared_folder is the path to the shared folder on my computer. /home/housing/shared_folder is the path to the shared folder inside the Docker container. When these lines run, the very last CMD statement from the Dockerfile runs, moving the contents from inside the Docker container to our computer. If you check the contents of the shared_folder on your computer, you will see analyse_data.html in there.\nThat’s it, we have now a complete reproducible analytical pipeline. We managed to tick every one of the following boxes when running our pipeline:\n\nSame version of R that was used for development;\nSame versions of all the packages that were used for development;\nThe whole stack runs on a “frozen” environment;\nWe can reproduce this environment (but more on that later…).\n\nWe now need to share all this with the world. One simple solution is to share the Dockerfile on Github. For example, this is the repository11 with all the required code to build the Docker image and run the pipeline. But we could also share the built image so that users only need to run the pipeline to instantly get the results. In the next section, we will learn about dockerizing development environments, and then see how we can share images that have already been built."

What we learned up until now was how to dockerize one single pipeline. In this section, we will learn how to build and dockerize an environment, and then build pipelines that use these environment as starting points.\nLet me first explain, again, why (or when) you might want to use his approach instead of the “dockerizing pipelines” approach.\nDepending on what or where you work, it is sometimes necessary to have a stable development environment that only gets rarely updated (following a strict schedule). In my own experience, when I was doing research I was almost always using the latest R version and packages. When I’ve joined the private sector, we worked on an environment that we developers could not update ourselves. That environment was updated according to a fixed schedule and now that I’m back in the public sector (but not doing research), I work in a similar manner, on a “frozen” environment. Working on frozen environments like this minimizes the unexpected issues that frequent updates can bring. So how can we use Docker to use such an approach?\nThe idea is to split up the Dockerfile we used in the previous section into two parts. The first part would consist in setting up everything that is “OS-related”. So installing R, packages, and system-level dependencies. The second Dockerfile would use the image defined thanks to the first Dockerfile as a base and then add the required lines to obtain the results from the pipeline. The first image, that focuses on the operating system, can be archived and re-used for as long as required to keep building pipelines. Once we update our environment, we can then re-generate a new Docker image that reflects this update.\nLet’s do this now. The first image would simply consist of these lines:\nFROM rocker/r-ver:4.2.2\n\nRUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \\\n    libglpk-dev \\\n    libxml2-dev \\\n    libcairo2-dev \\\n    libgit2-dev \\\n    default-libmysqlclient-dev \\\n    libpq-dev \\\n    libsasl2-dev \\\n    libsqlite3-dev \\\n    libssh2-1-dev \\\n    libxtst6 \\\n    libcurl4-openssl-dev \\\n    libharfbuzz-dev \\\n    libfribidi-dev \\\n    libfreetype6-dev \\\n    libpng-dev \\\n    libtiff5-dev \\\n    libjpeg-dev \\\n    libxt-dev \\\n    unixodbc-dev \\\n    wget \\\n    pandoc\n\nRUN R -e \"install.packages('remotes')\"\n\nRUN R -e \"remotes::install_github('rstudio/renv@0.16.0')\"\nThis image can then be built using docker build -t dev_env_r . (if you followed along, the cache will be used and this image should get built instantly). This simply installs all the packages and system-level dependencies that are common and needed for all pipelines. Then, each specific package libraries that are required for each pipeline will get installed using the pipeline-specific renv.lock file. This will be done with a second Dockerfile. But first, we need to make the dev_env_r image available to others, such that it becomes possible to build new images upon dev_env_r. There are two ways to make images available to anyone: either online through Docker Hub (in case there’s nothing preventing you from sharing the development environment through Docker Hub) or locally, by compressing the images and sharing them internally (in case you don’t want to share your images with the world, because they contain proprietary software that you’ve developed within your company for example). I want to stress that making the image available through Docker Hub is different from sharing the Dockerfile through Github. You could just share the Dockerfiles through Github, and then tell users to first build the dev environment, and then build the pipeline image by building the second, pipeline-specific Dockerfile. But by sharing a built image from Docker Hub, users (including future you) will only need to build the pipeline-specific image and this is much faster. Just like we used FROM ubuntu:jammy in our Dockerfiles before, we will now use something like FROM my_repo/my_image:version_number from now on.\nIn the next section I will discuss sharing images on Docker Hub, but before that, let me first address the elephant in the room: the development environment that you are using may not be the one you are dockerizing. For example, if you are using Windows or macOS on your computer, then the environment that you are dockerizing will be different since it will be based on Ubuntu. There are only three solutions to this conundrum:\n\nYou don’t care, and maybe that’s fine. As I stated multiple times, the same pipeline outputting different results due to different operating systems is in practice rare (but it can happen);\nYou prefer being safe than sorry, and install Ubuntu on your pc as well. This is very often not an acceptable solution, however.\nYou develop on your host environment, but after you’re done you compare the results obtained from the Docker container to those obtained on your development environment.\nYou use the Docker image not only to ship RAPs, but also for development.\n\nThe last option implies that you use Docker interactively, which is not ideal, but it is possible. For example, you could install RStudio server and run a Dockerized version of RStudio from a running Docker container. This is actually what happens if you follow the instructions on the Rocker project’s homepage. You can get a dockerized RStudio instance by running:\ndocker run --rm -ti -e PASSWORD=yourpassword -p 8787:8787 rocker/rstudio\nand then going to http://localhost:8787 on your web-browser. You can then log in with the username “rstudio” and the password “yourpassword”. But you would also need to mount a volume (I called it “shared folder” previously) to keep the files you edit on your computer (remember, Docker container are immutable, so any files created within a Docker container will be lost when it’s stopped). Overall, I think that this is too cumbersome, especially because the risks of getting different results only because of your operating system are very, very, very low. I would simply advise the following:\n\nUse the same version of R on your computer and on Docker;\nUse the same package library on your computer and on Docker by using the same renv.lock file.\n\nBy following these two rules, you should keep any issues to a minimum. When or if you need to update R and/or the package library on your machine, simply create a new Docker image that reflects these changes.\nHowever, if work in a field where operating system versions matter, then yes, you should find a way to either use the dockerized environment for development, or you should install Ubuntu on your computer (the same version as in Docker of course).\nLet’s now discuss sharing images.\n\n\n14.6.2 Sharing images through Docker Hub\nIf you want to share Docker images through Docker Hub, you first need to create a free account. A free account gives you unlimited public repositories. If you want to make your images private, you need a paid account. For our purposes though, a free account is more than enough. Again, in the next section, we will discuss how you can build new images upon other images without using Docker Hub.\nIf you want to follow along, make sure that you have also written a Dockerfile and built an image that you can upload on Docker Hub. I will be uploading the image dev_env_r to Docker Hub, so if you want you could use for your own projects.\nIf you built an image to upload, now is the right moment to talk about the docker images command. This will list all the images available on your computer. You should see something like this:\nREPOSITORY         TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED       SIZE\nrver_intro         latest    d3764d067534   2 days ago    1.61GB\ndev_env_r          latest    92fcf973ba42   2 days ago    1.42GB\nraps_ubuntu_r      latest    7dabadf3c7ee   4 days ago    1.04GB\nrocker/tidyverse   4.2.2     545e4538a28a   3 weeks ago   2.19GB\nrocker/r-ver       4.2.2     08942f81ec9c   3 weeks ago   824MB\nTake note of the image id of the dev_env_r image (second line), we will use it to push our image to Docker Hub. Also, don’t be alarmed by the size of the images, because this is a bit misleading. Different images that use the same base (so here Ubuntu Jammy), will reuse “layers” such that they don’t actually take up the size that is printed by docker images. So if images A and B both use Ubuntu Jammy as a base, but image A has RStudio installed and B also RStudio but Python as well, most of the space that A and B take up will be shared. The only difference will be that B will need a little bit more space for Python.\nYou can also list the running containers with docker container ls (or docker ps). If a container is running you should see something like this:\nCONTAINER ID   IMAGE              COMMAND   CREATED\n545e4538a28a   rocker/tidyverse   \"/init\"   3 minutes ago\n\nSTATUS         PORTS                                       NAMES\nUp 3 minutes   0.0.0.0:8787-&gt;8787/tcp, :::8787-&gt;8787/tcp   elastic_morse\nYou can stop the container by running docker stop CONTAINER ID. So, list the images again using docker images. Take note of the image id of the image you want to push to Docker Hub.\nNow, log in to Docker Hub using docker login (yes, from your terminal). You will be asked for your credentials, and if log in is successful, you see a message Log In Succeeded in your terminal (of course, you need first to have an account on Docker Hub).\nNow, you need to tag the image (this gives it a version number). So you would write something like:\nowner@localhost ➤ docker tag IMAGE_ID your_username_on_docker_hub/your_image:version1\nso in my case, it would be:\nowner@localhost ➤ docker tag 92fcf973ba42 rap4all/dev_env_r:4.2.2\nNext, I need to push it using docker push:\nowner@localhost ➤ docker push rap4all/dev_env_r:4.2.2\nowner@localhost $ docker push rap4all/dev_env_r:4.2.2\nYou can go check your profile and your repositories, you should see your image there. In my case, you can find the image here.\nThis image can now be used as a stable base for developing our pipelines. Here’s how I can now use this base image for my housing pipeline:\nFROM rap4all/dev_env_r:4.2.2\n\nRUN mkdir /home/housing\n\nRUN mkdir /home/housing/pipeline_output\n\nRUN mkdir /home/housing/shared_folder\n\nCOPY renv.lock /home/housing/renv.lock\n\nCOPY functions /home/housing/functions\n\nCOPY analyse_data.Rmd /home/housing/analyse_data.Rmd\n\nCOPY _targets.R /home/housing/_targets.R\n\nRUN R -e \"setwd('/home/housing');renv::init();renv::restore()\"\n\nRUN cd /home/housing && R -e \"targets::tar_make()\"\n\nCMD mv /home/housing/pipeline_output/* /home/housing/shared_folder/\nTake a look at this Dockerfile’s first line: FROM rap4all/dev_env_r:4.2.2. This is different from before, where I pulled from ubuntu:jammy. Now I’m re-using the image that defines the development environment, and I can do so for as many projects as necessary. In time, I could update to a newer version of R, if required. But R and (Ubuntu) being quite stable, as long as I can install the packages required for my projects, I can keep using it for years (and LTS versions of Ubuntu like Jammy get supported for 5 years).\nIf you want to test this, you could delete all images and containers from your system. This way, when you will build the image using the above Dockerfile, it will have to pull from Docker Hub. To delete all containers, start by using docker system prune. You can then delete all images using docker rmi $(docker images -a -q). This should remove everything. Now, let’s build the image using the above Dockerfile using docker build -t housing_image . (don’t forget to add the necessary files for the build process to succeed, renv.lock, _targets.R, analyse_data.Rmd and the functions folder). You should see the image getting pulled from Docker Hub and then the build process resuming and the pipeline running.\nIn the next section, I’ll explain to you how you can re-use base images like we just did, but without using Docker Hub, in case you cannot, or do not want, to rely on it.\n\n\n14.6.3 Sharing a compressed archive of your image\nIf you can’t upload the image on Docker Hub, you can still “save it” into a file and share that file instead (internally to your institution/company).\nRun docker save to save the image into a file:\nowner@localhost ➤ docker save dev_env_r &gt; dev_env_r.tar\nThis will create a .tar file of the image. You can then compress this file with an archiving tool if you want. If you’re on Linux, you could do so in one go (this will take some time):\nowner@localhost ➤ docker save dev_env_r | gzip &gt; dev_env_r.tgz\nIf you want to load this image, use docker load:\nowner@localhost ➤ docker load &lt; dev_env_r.tar\nyou should see an output like this:\n202fe64c3ce3: Loading layer [======================&gt;]  80.33MB/80.33MB\ne7484d5519b7: Loading layer [======================&gt;]  6.144kB/6.144kB\na0f5608ee4a8: Loading layer [======================&gt;]  645.4MB/645.4MB\n475d1d69813f: Loading layer [======================&gt;]  102.9kB/102.9kB\nd7963749937d: Loading layer [======================&gt;]  108.9MB/108.9MB\n224a0042a76f: Loading layer [======================&gt;]    600MB/600MB\na75e978c1654: Loading layer [======================&gt;]  605.7kB/605.7kB\n7efc10233531: Loading layer [======================&gt;]  1.474MB/1.474MB\nLoaded image: dev_env_r:latest\n\nor if you compressed the file on Linux, you can also use:\nowner@localhost ➤ docker load -i dev_env_r.tgz\nto load the archive.\nYou can then use dev_env_r for a pipeline by using this FROM statement in your Dockerfile:\nFROM dev_env_r\nSince the image is available locally, it’ll get used instead of pulling it from Docker Hub. So in case you cannot use Docker Hub, you could build the base images, compress them, and share them on your corporate network. Then, people can simply download them and load them and build new images on top of them.\nSo in summary, here’s how you can share images with the world, your colleagues, or future you:\n\nOnly share the Dockerfiles. Users need to build the images.\nShare images on Docker Hub. It’s up to you if you want to share a base image with the required development environment, and then separate, smaller images for the pipelines, or if you want to share a single image which contains everything.\nShare images but only within your workplace.\n\nWhatever option you go for, I hope that I’ve convinced you that Docker is really convenient. It may look complicated at first, but it saves a lot of headaches in the long run. Let me finish this section by stating something plainly: up until now, I tried to sell to you the idea that reproducibility did not require any extra effort, if you simply used the tools and techniques discussed in this book right from the start, with the added benefit of improving the quality of the code of your pipeline. I truly believe this to be the case with everything that I’ve shown up until now, but Docker. Using Docker for reproducibility does require some extra effort. However, if your projects require reproducibility, and you really want to play it safe, I think that Docker is unavoidable. It takes time to set up, but once it’s done, you do not have to think about the infrastructure anymore and can focus on developing. Also, if you need to maintain your pipeline and keep running it against newer and newer versions of R, you simply need to change one line (the FROM statement, for example, from Ubuntu Jammy to Ubuntu 24.04, the next LTS) in the Dockerfile to update everything to the latest version of R.\nBut, there is still a “little” issue, that I’m discussing in the next section."

    "text": "14.7 Some issues of relying on Docker\n\n14.7.1 The problems of relying so much on Docker\nSo we now know how to build truly reproducible analytical pipelines, but let’s be blunt, relying entirely on one single tool, Docker, is a bit of an issue… it’s a single point of failure. But the problem is not Docker itself, but the infrastructure.\nLet me explain: Docker is based on many different open-source parts, and that’s great. This means that even if the company behind Docker ruins it by taking some weird decisions, we have alternatives that build upon the open-source parts of Docker. There’s Podman, which is a drop-in replacement (when combined with other tools) made by Red Hat, which is completely open-source as well. So the risk does not come from there, because even if for some reason Docker would disappear, or get abandoned or whatever, we could still work with Podman, and it would also be technically possible to create a fork from Docker.\nBut the issue is the infrastructure. For now, using Docker and more importantly hosting images is free for personal use, education, open-source communities and small businesses. So this means that a project like Rocker likely pays nothing for hosting all the images they produce (but who knows, I may be wrong on this). Docker recently announced that they would abandon their Docker Free Team subscription plans that some open-source organizations use, and that they should upgrade to a paid subscription within 30 days. So it is not unreasonable to think that free users with a free account might also be forced to pay one day. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying that Docker is not allowed to make money. But it is something that you need to keep in mind in case you cannot afford a subscription (and who knows how much it’s going to cost). This is definitely a risk that needs mitigation, and a plan B. This plan B could be to host the images yourself, by saving them using docker save. Or you could even self-host an image registry (or lobby your employer/institution/etc to host a registry for its developers/data scientists/researchers). In any case, it’s good to have options and now what potential risks using this technology entail.\n\n\n14.7.2 Is Docker enough?\nI would say that for 99% of applications, yes, Docker is enough for building RAPs. But strictly speaking, using a Dockerfile which installs a specific version of R and uses {renv} to install specific versions of packages and use an LTS release of Ubuntu, we could end up with two different images. This is because Ubuntu gets updated, so if you build an image in the beginning of 2022 and then once again in 2023, the system-level libraries will be different. So strictly speaking, you end up with two different images, and it’s not absolutely impossible that this may impact your pipeline. So ideally, we would also need a way to always install the same system-level dependencies, regardless of when we build the image. There is a package manager called Nix that makes this possible, but this is outside the scope of this book. The reason is that, again, in practice if you use an LTS release you should be fine. But if you really require bitwise reproducibility (i.e., two runs of the same pipeline will yield the same result to the last bit), then yes, you should definitely look into Nix (and who knows, I might write a book just about that titled Building bitwise reproducible analytical pipelines (braps) using Nix).\nAnother issue with Docker is that images can be quite opaque, especially if you define images that pull from images that pull themselves from other images… Just look at our pipeline: it pulls from dev_env_r, which pulls from rocker:4.2.2 which pulls itself from the official Ubuntu Jammy image. So to be fully transparent, we would need to link to all the Dockerfiles, or rewrite one big Dockerfile that pulls from Ubuntu Jammy only."

    "text": "15.1 CI/CD quickstart for R programmers (and others)\nBefore defining an “Hello World” pipeline that gets executed in the cloud, I need to define some terms. A workflow that runs on Github Actions is defined as a Yaml file, and this file contains a succession of “actions”, and each action performs a specific task. Here is the simplest Github Actions workflow file that you could write (source: link4):\nname: hello-world\non: push\njobs:\n  my-job:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: my-step\n        run: echo \"Hello World!\"\nThis needs to be saved in a hello_world.yml file, and placed inside the .github/workflows/ directories in the Github repository you want this action to run each time something gets pushed to the repo.\nEach time code gets pushed to the repository containing this workflow file, a runner runs the code echo \"Hello World!\" on the latest version of Ubuntu. A workflow file is thus defined as a series of steps, that can either run code, or an action (more on actions later) that get executed on a so-called runner (in essence, a container). This workflow gets executed when a specific event occurs, in the example above that event is pushing to the repo. To see the output of the workflow, click on “Actions” on your Github repository:\n\n\n\nClick on ‘Actions’ to monitor your workflows.\n\n\nYou should see a list of workflow runs, each corresponding to a commit. Click on the latest one and then click on the job named my-job. If your workflow has multiple jobs, they’ll all be listed here. Once you click on the job, you should see a list of steps. The step that interested us here is my-step which should simply print “Hello World!”. Click on it to see the output:\n\n\n\nCongrats, that’s your first GA workflow.\n\n\nTo help you define complex workflows, you can use pre-defined actions that you can choose from to perform a series of common tasks. You can find them in the Github Actions Marketplace5.\nWe are not going to use any actions from the Github Actions Marketplace just yet though, but instead, we will be looking at a repository containing actions specifically made for R users (if you’re using another programming language, it is quite likely that you might find a repository of actions for that programming language).\nThis repository6 contains many actions for R users. For example, let’s say that you want to install R and run some code using Github Actions. Simply take a look at the setup-r7 and and see how it’s used. Let me edit my hello_world.yml from before, and add one step that downloads R and prints \"Hello from R!\" using R:\nname: hello-from-R\non: push\njobs:\n  my-job:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: hello-from-bash\n        run: echo \"Hello from Bash!\"\n        \n      - name: checkout-repo\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n        \n      - name: install-r\n        uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@v2\n        with:\n          r-version: '3.5.3'\n      \n      - name: hello-r\n        run: Rscript -e 'print(\"Hello from R!\")'\nSo now my job performs two tasks, one that prints \"Hello from Bash!\" and another that prints \"Hello from R!\". There are several steps involved, the second step, called checkout-repo runs the action actions/checkout@v3 and the third step, called install-r uses the action r-lib/actions/setup-r@v2. The first action, actions/checkout@v3 is an action that you will see on almost any Github Actions workflow file, even though it is likely superfluous in this case. You can read about it here8 and it essentially makes the files inside the repository available to the runner. Sometimes I think that it would have made more sense to call this action clone, like the git clone command. But I’m sure there’s a very good reason that this is not the case. The next action is setup-r@v2 which downloads and installs, in our example here, R version 3.5.3. The final step then runs the command Rscript -e 'print(\"Hello from R!\")'. If you check out the “Actions” tab on Github, you should now see this:\n\n\n\nThis time it’s R that’s waving hello.\n\n\nWe could have installed any other version of R by the way. We can keep adding steps, for example let’s add one to install {renv} and install packages from an renv.lock file (the file needs to be in our repository, and becomes available to the workflow thanks to actions/checkout@v3):\nname: my-pipeline\non: push\njobs:\n  my-job:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04\n    steps:\n        \n      - name: checkout-repo\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n        \n      - name: install-r\n        uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@v2\n        with:\n          r-version: '4.2.2'\n      \n      - name: install-renv\n        uses: r-lib/actions/setup-renv@v2\nI think you’re starting to see where this is going. This workflow runs on Ubuntu 22.04, installs R version 4.2.2 and installs all the packages defined in the renv.lock file stored in our repository (and if you don’t have an renv.lock file, only {renv} will get installed). So to have our RAP running in the cloud, we would simply need to add the other required files and finish writing the workflow. One note of warning though: if you’re running pipelines defined like the above, each time you push, every step will run from scratch (apart from package installation using r-lib/actions/setup-renv@v2 because packages will be cached for future runs of the workflow), and this may take some time to run."

    "text": "15.2 Running a RAP using Github Actions\nBecause running {targets} pipelines on Github Actions is a common task, there is of course a way to do it very easily, without the need to write our own workflow file. Simply go to the folder that contains your pipeline (which, I hope, is versioned using Git, right?), open an R session and run targets::tar_github_actions(). This will automatically create a folder called .github/ in the root of your pipeline’s folder, with inside a workflows/ folder, and inside a targets.yaml workflow file. This file is ready to use, but you may adapt it to your needs. For example, this workflow file runs on ubuntu-latest and installs the latest version of R. You may want to change the version of Ubuntu to ubuntu-22.04 (this way, Ubuntu 22.04 will keep getting used even when the next LTS, 24.04, will be released) and install R version 4.2.2 (or whichever version you used for your pipeline). Also, don’t forget to install the Ubuntu dependencies under the “Install Linux System dependencies” step. There’s already some dependencies there, but you should add the others that we’ve listed in the Dockerfile (the syntax is slightly different from the Dockerfile, so pay attention to it). This workflow file also runs some other useful actions, like caching packages, so they don’t need to get re-downloaded each time you push a change to the repository!\nYou can see the repository with the workflow file here9. The workflow file is inside the .github/workflows/ folder here10. As I explained before, pay attention to line 29 (where I stated that the action should trigger when a change gets pushed to the branch gitops-pipeline), to line 35 where I changed the runner from ubuntu-latest to ubuntu-22.04, line 43 where I install R version 4.2.2 and finally lines 53 to 74 where I install the required Ubuntu dependencies (the same as for the Dockerfile). Don’t hesitate to use this repository as a template for your projects! The rendered HTML file is in the newly created targets-runs branch of the repository. This branch gets created automatically by the workflow and the output gets saved in there automatically.\nSo it turns out that running a RAP on Github Actions is quite easy, you only need to use targets::tar_github_actions(), and adapt the targets.yaml file a little bit to install the right version of R and run it on the right version of Ubuntu (or Windows or macOS, but careful, you only have 2000 free minutes and Windows and macOS are more expensive than Ubuntu, 1 minute of CPU time on Ubuntu is equal to 2 minutes of run-time on macOS). By using {renv} and the generated renv.lock file, the pipeline dependencies get installed seamlessly as well. You can now focus on coding, each time you push to this branch, you will see the output get generated (and because caching is being used, runs will executed rather quickly).\nBut, and yes there is a but, you should think about the following, potential, issues:\n\nyou are limited to 2000 minutes of free run-time. If your pipeline takes several hours to run, you might need to upgrade to a paid account, or run it locally (but this is mitigated thanks to caching on Github and by using {targets} that caches results as well);\nGithub Actions does not keep old versions of operating systems for too long. For example, as of writing, only versions 20.04 and 22.04 of Ubuntu are available. Ubuntu 18.04 was removed in August 2022. If your RAP absolutely needs a specific version of Ubuntu for a very long time, Github Actions might not be the right solution. The same is true for Windows or macOS as well. However, what you might want to do instead is migrate the pipeline to newer versions of Ubuntu when these become available. Generally speaking, this should not be a very painful process.\n\nSo you need to think about what it is you really need. Does your pipeline run relatively quickly, and you don’t need to keep it running forever on the same operating system? Then Github Actions is for you. Or perhaps you are writing a book using Rmarkdown, or Quarto and don’t want to bother building it and deploying it manually? Then Github Actions is for you as well (and take a look at this book’s workflow file here11 for an example of exactly this). But if you are working on a pipeline that may take several hours to run, and you want it to stay reproducible for a very long time, then using Docker might be a better option. Thankfully, you can also use Github Actions to build Docker images and upload them to Docker Hub. You can even then run a Docker container that runs your RAP (but here again, if your pipeline takes several hours to run, you may not want to do that)."

    "text": "15.3 Craft a dockerized development environment with Github Actions\nThis section and the next are going to mirror the sections on dockerizing projects and dockerizing development environments from the previous chapter. The only difference is that all the heavy lifting will happen on Github Actions, instead of our own computer.\nI’m going to describe the following repository12. This repository contains a Dockerfile, and a .github/workflows/ folder with a Github Actions workflow file. Each time I push any change to any file from this repository, a new Docker image gets built automatically and pushed to Docker Hub. The image that gets built defines a development environment that we will then use for our RAPs.\nAs stated before, the advantage of using Docker images for your RAPs instead of simply running them directly inside Github Actions (as in the previous section), is that you don’t rely on Github to have the base image (in our example, ubuntu-22.04), forever available, which they won’t.\nThe idea is the same as before: work on the code of your project, define a Dockerfile and get an updated image each time you push your changes to the repository.\nLet’s start with the Github Actions workflow file that we need. Here it is:\nname: build_docker\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - master\n      - main\n\njobs:\n  docker:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    env:\n      IMAGE_NAME: r_4.2.2\n    steps:\n      - name: Setup\n        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v2\n      - name: Login to Docker Hub\n        uses: docker/login-action@v2\n        with:\n          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}\n          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}\n      - name: Build image and push to Docker Hub\n        uses: docker/build-push-action@v4\n        with:\n          tags: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}/${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}:\n            ${{ github.ref_name }}-${{ github.sha }}\n          push: true\nJust one remark: I had to split the tags: line into two lines. When copying this line into the yaml file, put the two lines back into one line. Click here13 for the actual file.\nI believe that this file is the simplest one you could have for this. Let’s study it in detail.\nThe start of the file is pretty standard: we give the workflow a name, and state that it should run on ubuntu-latest whenever anything gets pushed to either main or master. We define an environment variable called r_4.2.2. This is the name of the image that we are going to build. We will build an image that comes with R 4.2.2 pre-installed as well as many required Ubuntu packages; it’s the same image as we built in the previous chapter on top of which we will then build RAPs. This image is based on the one from the Rocker project. We will take a look at the Dockerfile afterwards. Then, the action docker/setup-buildx-action@v2 simply sets up everything for buildx to run smoothly (buildx will build the Docker image using the docker buildx command an alternative to docker build). Honestly, I don’t even know exactly what it sets up. I guess it may at least checkout the repository to make the files available to the next actions and maybe set some other variables for docker buildx.\nThen we use the docker/login-action@v2 to login from Github Actions to Docker Hub. Essentially, we need to be able to tell our Github Actions runner how to login to Docker Hub, and of course we want to do so in a secure manner (and it must run non-interactively). To login to Docker Hub from Github Actions, you need first to create an access token from your Docker Hub account. Login to your Docker Hub account, go to your account settings and then to the “Security” tab:\n\n\n\nCreate your access token.\n\n\nName it github_actions for example, and set its permissions to “Read, Write, Delete”. On the next window that pops up, make sure to save your access token:\n\n\n\nMake sure to write it down!\n\n\nYou then need to go to the settings area of the repository. Under “Security”, “Secrets and variables” and finally “Actions” you can create a secret called DOCKERHUB_TOKEN and copy the value of the token in the free text area:\n\n\n\nCopy the token in your repo’s secrets.\n\n\nCreate a second secret with your Docker Hub username called DOCKERHUB_USERNAME. These can now be used in the workflow file using so-called contexts. Your Docker Hub username will get replaced wherever you write ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }} in the workflow file, same for your Docker Hub token with ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}.\nFinally, we build and push the image to Docker Hub. This is done using one single action called docker/build-push-action@v4. We use the tags option to tag our image. The tag needs to start with your username, followed by a /, then the image name, and then a version, so something like bob/r_4.2.2:latest where latest would be the latest version of the image that is available. Getting bob/r_4.2.2 is quite easy: simply use your Docker Hub username that you defined as a secret, then literally type / and then use the image name that you’ve defined in the beginning of the workflow file. Careful though: bob/r_4.2.2 needs to exist on Docker Hub as well. bob is easy, that’s your Docker Hub username as already stated, but r_4.2.2 is a repository that you need to create on Docker Hub. So both your image name and the repository name on Docker Hub will be r_4.2.2. If you don’t create a repository on Docker Hub that is exactly named like that, your image will not get pushed, because Github Actions will not know where to push the image. So if this is not already the case, go back to Docker Hub and create a repository named r_4.2.2. For the version, you can do whatever you want, but I suggest to use the context github.ref_name and github.sha. github.ref_name gives the name of the branch that starts the workflow, and github.sha returns the hash number of the commit that starts the workflow. This way, your image will be named something like bob/r_4.2.2:master-65ai9besta65948. This allows you to see which commit generated which image, which is really useful. We then also set push to true, so that the image gets pushed.\nWith this workflow file in hand, I can now build a Docker image and push it to Docker Hub simply by pushing code to my repository. Here are two commits that generated two images:\n\n\n\nTwo successful runs of Github Actions.\n\n\nand here are the two corresponding images on Docker Hub:\n\n\n\nThe corresponding images on Docker Hub.\n\n\nI noticed a typo in my Dockerfile: originally, I was basing my image on R version 4.2.1. So I changed this, and pushed. This is the commit that starts with b1950. The image then got built, tagged, and pushed to Docker Hub without any manual intervention on my part. You can see that the tag is of the form repo-hash, in this case main-b1950d. Clicking on this tag on Docker Hub shows you some useful information:\n\n\n\nThis is the image with the correct R version."

    "text": "15.4 Run a RAP using a dockerized development environment on Github Actions\nNow that we have a dockerized development environment that gets built by pushing changes to a Github repo, it is now time to use it for our RAPs. As I wrote in the beginning, this will mirror the section on running a RAP that uses a dockerized environment, so we can start from that repository. This14 was the repository that we used at the time. You can create a new repository with the same content (but you can remove the .gitignore file, it won’t be needed here). This is what my repository15 looks like. The only difference with the first repository is the Dockerfile and the Github Actions workflow file that is inside .github/workflows. Let’s take a look at the Dockerfile first:\nFROM brodriguesco/r_4.2.2:main-b1950d55ccbd8009de4ee2006a097c3e7ef1c529\n\nRUN mkdir /home/housing\n\nRUN mkdir /home/housing/pipeline_output\n\nRUN mkdir /home/housing/shared_folder\n\nCOPY renv.lock /home/housing/renv.lock\n\nCOPY functions /home/housing/functions\n\nCOPY analyse_data.Rmd /home/housing/analyse_data.Rmd\n\nCOPY _targets.R /home/housing/_targets.R\n\nRUN R -e \"setwd('/home/housing');renv::init();renv::restore()\"\n\nRUN cd /home/housing && R -e \"targets::tar_make()\"\n\nCMD mv /home/housing/pipeline_output/* /home/housing/shared_folder/\nIt is almost exactly the same as the one from the dockerized pipeline from the previous chapter. The only difference is the very first statement, where we pull the base image. Now I’m using the image from the dockerized environment that I’ve built in the previous section. Apart from that, everything’s the same.\nThe magic happens with the workflow file. Here it is:\nname: Reproducible pipeline\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - main\n      - master\n\njobs:\n\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n    - name: Checkout repository\n      uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n    - name: Build the Docker image\n      run: docker build -t housing_image .\n\n    - name: Docker Run Action\n      run: &gt; \n        docker run --rm --name housing_container -v\n        /github/workspace/shared_folder:/home/housing/shared_folder:rw \n        housing_image\n\n    - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3\n      with:\n        name: housing_output_${{ github.sha }}\n        path: /github/workspace/shared_folder/\nBy now, you should certainly understand this workflow file without much trouble. First we checkout the contents of the repository to make the files available to the other steps. Then we build the Docker image. For this, I’m doing this the “old-school” way by using the actual command that we would use on our local machine. Then we run the container. Once again I use the command that I would use locally. But you’ll notice that I use /github/workspace/shared_folder as the path to the shared folder. You likely guessed it, /github/workspace/ is the “local” path inside the Github Actions runner. This is equivalent to the /home/ directory on a Linux machine. The command is also on multiple lines (to write a command over multiple lines on github actions, you need to start by &gt; and then use as many lines as you need).\nThe final action, actions/upload-artifact@v3 is used to upload the contents of the shared folder and name them housing_output_${{ github.sha }}, where ${{ github.sha }} will get replaced by the hash from the commit that triggered the action. This will be a zip file that you can then download. But download from where?\nSimply click on the “Actions” tab on the Github repository, and then click on the run that you want the artifact from (pipeline outputs are called artifacts):\n\n\n\nArtifacts (pipeline outputs) can be found by going into a run’s details.\n\n\nAnd that’s it! You could tweak the workflow file to instead push the files to a new branch in the repository, like the workflow file that targets::tar_github_actions() generates. But I think that this solution is easier to use, and also, if you need to download the artifact from a previous run, it’s all right there. Simply select a previous run and download the artifact. If instead you push the outputs to a new branch, you’d need to revert to that commit to get past outputs."

    "text": "15.5 Conclusion\nAt the start of this chapter, I stated that this chapter was optional, because it is not necessary to use a CI/CD service to ensure that your projects are reproducible. However, I believe that setting up your project to make it run on Github Actions (or any other CI/CD service) truly forces you to master all the topics presented in this book. In the conclusion of part 1 of the book, I wrote that it seemed as if functional programming was only about putting restrictions on our code, for very little gain. In some ways, forcing yourself to use a CI/CD service can feel similar. But here’s the thing: if your project builds successfully on a CI/CD service, and if the results remain stable through time, then your project is reproducible. Someone else could then run it locally by simply following the same steps as in the workflow file, which would consist of the very same basic steps: clone the repository, build a Docker image and run a container (or set up the required R package library using {renv} and then run the pipeline with {targets} if you’re not using Docker).\nIf you work in research, but cannot push the data to Github, you could always work on the code and the infrastructure using synthetic data for instance. The repository alongside the synthetic data could then be a nice complement to the paper (but again, only in case the data cannot be published)."

    "text": "Congratulations, you’re done with the book and I hope you learned a thing or two.\nPart 1 focused on teaching you best practices, tools and techniques to make your code as clean as possible. In part 2, I taught you how to turn your project into a pipeline, and then how to make this pipeline reproducible using {renv} and Docker. To summarise, here are all the things that we need to think about to write a RAP:\n\nWrite code that is as clean as possible: keep it DRY, document and test it well;\nRecord package dependencies of the project;\nRecord the R version that you use;\nUse a tool that builds the project for you;\nRecord the computational environment.\n\nIf you tick all these boxes, you, or anyone else, should not have any problems reproducing the results of your project. While it may seem that ticking these boxes takes up valuable time from other tasks, if you use the techniques and tools that I’ve showed you in part 1, this should not be the case, and you might end up even gaining time. The only exception to this will be preparing a Docker image, but if you supply at the very least an renv.lock file, creating a Docker image to run a project could even be done much later, and only if it’s really needed (and maybe even by someone else).\n\n“So what?”\nIf you’ve reached this conclusion and are still thinking “meh, yeah, reproducibility is nice and all, but… so what?” I hope that this last attempt of mine to convince you that RAPs are important will be successful.\nSo, why bother building RAPs? Firstly, there are purely technical considerations. It is not impossible that in quite a near future, we will work on ever thinner clients while the heavy-duty computations will run on the cloud. Should this be the case, being comfortable with the topics discussed in this book will be valuable. Also, in this very near future, large language models will be able to set up most, if not all, of the required boilerplate code to set up a RAP. This means that you will be able to focus on analysis, but you still need to understand what are the different pieces of a RAP, and how they fit together, in order to understand the code that the large language model prepared for you, but also to revise it if needed. And it is not a stretch to imagine that simple analyses could be taken over by large language models as well. So you might very soon find yourself in a position where you will not be the one doing an analysis and setting up a RAP, but instead check, verify and adjust an analysis and a RAP built by an AI. Being familiar with the concepts laid out in this book will help you successfully perform these tasks in a world where every data scientist will have AI assistants.\nBut more importantly, the following factors are inherently part of data analysis:\n\ntransparency;\nsustainability;\nscalability.\n\nIt doesn’t matter if you’re working in research, for a public institution or a private sector company: the three points above are incredibly important and it’s impossible to perform data analysis without taking these into consideration, regardless of whether AIs take over some, or most, of the tasks you perform today. In the case of research, the publish or perish model has distorted incentives so much that unfortunately a lot of researchers are focused on getting published as quickly as possible, and see the three factors listed above as hurdles to getting published quickly. Herculean efforts have to be made to reproduce studies that are not reproducible, and more often than not, people that try to reproduce the results are unsuccessful. Thankfully, things are changing and there are more and more efforts being made to make research reproducible by design, and not as an afterthought. In the private sector, tight deadlines lead to the same problem: analysts think that making the project reproducible is an hindrance to being able to deliver on time. But here as well, taking the time to make the project reproducible will help with making sure that what is delivered is of high quality, and it will also help with making reusing existing code for future projects much easier, even further accelerating development.\nData analysis, at whatever level and for whatever field, is not just about getting to a result, the way to get to the result is part of it! This is true for science, this is true for industry, this is true everywhere. You get to decide where on the iceberg of reproducibility you want to settle, but the lower, the better.\nSo why build RAPs? Well, because there’s no alternative if you want to perform your work seriously."
