# Introduction

This book will not teach you about machine learning, statistics or
visualisation.

The goal is to teach you a set of tools, practices and project management
techniques that should make your projects easier to reproduce, replicate and
retrace. These tools and techniques can be used right from the start of your
project at a minimal cost, such that once you're done with the analysis, you're
also done with making the project reproducible. Your projects are going to be
reproducible simply because they were engineered, from the start, to be
reproducible.

There are two main ideas in this book that you need to keep in mind at all times:

- DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself;
- WIT: Write IT down.

DRY WIT is not only the best type of humour, it is also the best way to write
reproducible analytical pipelines.

## Who is this book for?

This book is for anyone that uses raw data to build any type of output based on
that raw data. This can be a simple quarterly report for example, in which the
data is used for tables and graphs, or a scientific article for a peer reviewed
journal or even an interactive web application. It doesn't matter, because the
process is, at its core, always very similar:

- Get the data;
- Clean the data;
- Write code to analyse the data;
- Put the results into the final product.

This book will already assume some familiarity with programming, and in
particular the R programming language. However, if you're comfortable with
another programming language like Python, you could still learn a lot from
reading this book. The tools presented in this book are specific to R, but
there will always be an alternative for the language you prefer using, meaning
that you could apply the advice from this book to your needs and preferences.

## What is the aim of this book?

The aim of this book is to make the process of analysing data as reliable,
retraceable, and reproducible as possible, and do this by design. This means
that once you're done with the analysis, you're done. You don't want to spend
time, which you often don't have anyways, to rewrite or refactor an analysis and
make it reproducible after the fact. We both know that this is not going to
happen. Once an analysis is done, it's time to go to the next analysis. And if
you need to rerun an older analysis (for example, because the data got updated),
then you'll simply figure it out at that point, right? That's a problem for
future you, right? Hopefully, future you will remember every quirk of your code
and know which script to run at which point in the process, which comments are
outdated and can be safely ignored, what features of the data need to be checked
(and when they need to be checked), and so on... You better hope future you is a
more diligent worker than you!

Going forward, I'm going to refer to a project that is reproducible as a
"reproducible analytical pipeline", or RAP for short. There are only two ways to
make such a RAP; either you are lucky enough to have someone on the team whose
job is to turn your messy code into a RAP, or you do it yourself. And this
second option is very likely the most common. The issue is, as stated above,
that most of us simply don't do it. We are always in the rush to get to the
results, and don't think about making the process reproducible. This is because
we always think that making the process reproducible takes time and this time is
better spent working on the analysis itself. But this is a misconception, for
two reasons.

The first reason is that employing the techniques that we are going to discuss
in this book won't actually take much time. As you will see, they're not really
things that you "add on top of the analysis", but will be part of the analysis
itself, and they will also help with managing the project. And some of these
techniques will even save you time (especially testing) and headaches.

The second reason is that an analysis is never, ever, a one-shot. Only the most
simple things, like pulling out a number from some data base may be a one-shot.
And even then, chances are that once you provide that number, you'll be asked to
pull out a variation of that number (for example, by disaggregating by one or
several variables). Or maybe you'll get asked for an update to that number in
six months. So you will learn very quickly to keep that SQL query in a script
somewhere to make sure that you provide a number that is consistent. But what
about more complex analyses? Is keeping the script enough? Keeping the script is
already a good start of course. The problem is that very often, there is no
script, or not a script for each step of the analysis.

I've seen this play out many times in many different organisations. It's that
time of the year again, we have to write a report. 10 people are involved, and
just gathering the data is already complicated. Some get their data from Word
documents attached to emails, some from a website, some from a report from
another department that is a PDF... I remember a story that a senior manager at
my previous job used to tell us: once, a client put out a call for a project
that involved helping them setting up a PDF scraper. They periodically needed
data from another department that came in PDFs. The manager asked what was, at
least from our perspective, an obvious question: why can't they send you the
underlying data from that PDF in a machine readable format? They had never
thought to ask. So my manager went to that department, and talked to the people
putting that PDF together. Their answer? "Well, we could send them the data in
any format they want, but they've asked us to send the tables in a PDF format".

So the first, and probably most important lesson here is: when starting to build
a RAP, make sure that you talk with all the people involved.

## Prerequisites

You should be comfortable with the R programming language. This book will assume
that you have been using R for some projects already, and want to improve not
only your knowledge of the language itself, but also how to successfully manage
complex projects. Ideally, you should know about packages, how to install them,
you should have written some functions already, know about loops and have some
basic knowledge of data structures like lists. While this is not a book on
visualisation, we will be making some graphs using the `{ggplot2}` package, so
if you're familiar with that, that's good. If not, no worries, visualisation,
data munging or data analysis is not the point of this book. Chapter 2, *Before
we start* should help you gauge how easily you will be able to follow this book.

Ideally, you should also not be afraid of not using Graphical User Interfaces
(GUIs). While you can follow along using an IDE like RStudio, I will not be
teaching any features from any program with a GUI. This is not to make things
harder than they should be (quite the contrary actually) but because interacting
graphically with a program is simply not reproducible. So our aim is to write
code that can be executed non-interactively by a machine. This is because one
necessary condition for a workflow to be reproducible and get referred to as a
RAP, is for the workflow to be able to be executed by a machine, automatically,
without any human intervention. This is the second lesson of building RAPs:
there should be no human intervention needed to get the outputs once the RAP is
started. If you achieve this, then your workflow is likely reproducible, or can
at least be made reproducible much more easily than if it requires some special
manipulation by a human somewhere in the loop.

## What actually is reproducibility?

A reproducible project means that this project can be rerun by anyone at 0 (or
very minimal) cost. But there are different levels of reproducibility, and I
will discuss this in the next section. Let's first discuss some requirements
that a project must have to be considered a RAP.

### Using open-source tools to build a RAP is a hard requirement

Open source is a hard requirement for reproducibility.

No ifs nor buts. And I'm not only talking about the code you typed for your
research paper/report/analysis. I'm talking about the whole ecosystem that you
used to type your code and build the workflow.

Is your code open? That's good. Or is it at least available to other people from
your organisation, in a way that they could re-execute it if needed? Good.

But is it code written in a proprietary program, like STATA, SAS or MATLAB? Then
your project is not reproducible. It doesn't matter if this code is well
documented and written and available on a version control system (internally to
your company or open to the public). This project is just not reproducible. Why?

Because on a long enough time horizon, there is no way to re-execute your code
with the exact same version of the proprietary programming language and on the
exact same version of the operating system that was used at the time the project
was developed. As I'm writing these lines, MATLAB, for example, is at version
R2022b. And buying an older version may not be simple. I'm sure if you contact
their sales department they might be able to sell you an older version. Maybe
you can even simply re-download older versions that you've already bought from their
website. But maybe it's not that simple. Or maybe they won't offer this option
anymore in the future, who knows? In any case, if you google "purchase old
version of Matlab" you will see that many researchers and engineers have this
need.

#| fig-cap: "Wanting to run older versions of analytics software is a recurrent need."
knitr::include_graphics("images/matlab_old_version.png")
```
:::

And if you're running old code written for version, say, R2008a, there's no
guarantee that it will produce the exact same results on version 2022b. And
let's not even mention the toolboxes (if you're not familiar with MATLAB's
toolboxes, they're the equivalent of packages or libraries in other programming
languages). These evolve as well, and there's no guarantee that you can purchase
older versions of said toolboxes. And it's likely that newer versions of
toolboxes cannot even run on older versions of Matlab.

And let me be clear, what I'm describing here with MATLAB could also be said for
any other proprietary programs still commonly (unfortunately) used in research
and in statistics (like STATA, SAS or SPSS). And even if some, or even all, of
the editors of these proprietary tools provide ways to buy and run older
versions of their software, my point is that the fact that you have to rely on
them for this is a barrier to reproducibility, and there is no guarantee they
will provide the option to purchase older versions forever. Also, who guarantees
that the editors of these tools will be around forever? Or, and that's more
likely, that they will keep offering a program that you install on your machine
instead of shifting to a subscription based model?

*For just $199 a month, you can execute your SAS (or whatever) scripts on the
cloud! Worry about data confidentiality? No worries, data gets encrypted and
stored safely on our secure servers! Run your analysis from anywhere and don't
worry about losing your work if your cat knocks over your coffee on your laptop!
And if you purchase the pro licence, for an additional $100 a month, you can
even execute your code in parallel!*

Think this is science fiction? Google "SAS cloud" to see SAS's cloud based
offering.

### There are hidden dependencies that can hinder the reproducibility of a project

Then there's another problem: let's suppose you've written a nice, thoroughly
tested and documented workflow, and made it available on Github (and let's even
assume that the data is available for people to freely download, and that the
paper is open access). Or, if you're working in the private sector, you did
everything above as well, the only difference being that the workflow is only
available to people inside the company instead of being available freely and
publicly online.

Let's further assume that you've used R or Python, or any other open source
programming language. Could this study/analysis be said to be reproducible?
Well, if the analysis ran on a proprietary operating system, then the conclusion
is: your project is not reproducible.

This is because the operating system the code runs on can also influence the
outputs that your pipeline builds. There are some particularities in operating
systems that may make certain things work differently. Admittedly, this is in
practice rarely a problem, but [it does
happen](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/9187)^[https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/9187],
especially if you're working with very high precision floating point arithmetic
like you would do in the financial sector for instance.

Thankfully, there is no need to change operating systems to deal with this
issue, and we will learn how to use Docker to safeguard against this problem.

### The requirements of a RAP

So where does that leave us? Basically, for something to be truly reproducible,
it has to respect the following bullet points:

- Source code must obviously be available and thoroughly tested and documented (which is why we will be using Git and Github);
- All the dependencies must be easy to find and install (we are going to deal with this using dependency management tools);
- To be written with an open source programming language (nocode tools like Excel are by default non-reproducible because they can't be used non-interactively, and which is why we are going to use the R programming language);
- The project needs to be run on an open source operating system (thankfully, we can deal with this without having to install and learn to use a new operating system, thanks to Docker);
- Data and the paper/report need obviously to be accessible as well, if not publicly as is the case for research, then within your company. This means that the concept of "scripts and/or data available upon request" belongs in the trash.

```

## Are there different types of reproducibility?

Let's take one step back: we live in the real world, and in the real world,
there are some constraints that are outside of our control. These constraints
can make it impossible to build a true RAP, so sometimes we need to settle for
something that might not be a true RAP, but a second or even third best thing.

In what follows, let's assume this: in the discussion below, code is tested and
documented, so let's only discuss the code running the pipeline itself.

The *worst* reproducible pipeline would be something that works, but only on
your machine. This can be simply due to the fact that you hardcoded paths that
only exist on your laptop. Anyone wanting to rerun the pipeline would need to
change the paths. This is something that needs to be documented in a README
which we assumed was the case, so there's that. But maybe this pipeline only
runs on your laptop because the computational environment that you're using is
hard to reproduce. Maybe you use software, even if it's open source software,
that is not easy to install (anyone that tried to install R packages on Linux
that depend on the `{rJava}` package know what I'm talking about).

So a least worse pipeline would be one that could be run more easily on any
similar machine to yours. This could be achieved by not using hardcoded absolute
paths, and by providing instructions to set up the environment. For example, in
the case of R, this could be as simple as providing a script called something
like `install_deps.R` that would be a call to `install.packages()`. It could
look like this:

```{r, eval = F}

install.packages(c("package1",
                   "package2",
                   etc))

```

The issue here is that you need to make sure that the right versions of the
packages get installed. If your script uses `{ggplot2}` version 2.2.1, then
users should install this version as well, and by running the script above, the
latest version of `{ggplot2}` (as of writing, version 3.4.0) will get installed.
Maybe that's not a problem, but it can be if your script uses a function from
version 2.2.1 that is not available anymore in the latest version (or maybe its
name got changed, or maybe it was modified somehow and doesn't provide the exact
same result). The more packages the script uses (and the older it is), the
higher the likelihood that some package version will not be compatible. There is
also the issue of the R version itself. Generally speaking, recent versions of R
seem to not be too bad when it comes to running older code written in R. I know
this because in 2022 I've run every example that comes bundled with R since
version 0.6.0 on the then current version (as of writing) of R, version 4.2.2.

Here is the result of this experiment:

```{r, echo = F}
#| fig-cap: "Examples from older versions of R run most of the time successfully on the current version of R"
knitr::include_graphics("images/wontrun.png")
```
:::

This graph shows the following: for each version of R, starting with R version
0.6.0 (released in 1997), how well the examples that came with a standard
installation of R run on the current version of R (version 4.2.2 as of writing).
These are the examples from the default packages like `{base}`, `{stats}`,
`{stats4}`, and so on. Turns out that more than 75% of the example code from
version 0.6.0 still work on the current version of R. A small fraction output a
message (which doesn't mean the code doesn't work), some 5% raise a warning,
which again doesn't necessarily mean that the code doesn't work, and finally
around 20% or so produce errors. As you can see, the closer we get to the current
release, the fewer errors get raised (if you want to run the code for yourself,
check out this [Github
repository](https://github.com/b-rodrigues/code_longevity)^[https://github.com/b-rodrigues/code_longevity]).

(But something important should be noted: just because some old piece of code
runs without error, doesn't mean that the result is exactly the same. There
might be cases where the same function returns different results on different
versions of R.)

While this is evidence of R itself being quite stable through time, there
are studies that show a less rosy picture. In a recent study (@trisovic2022
^[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01143-6]), some researchers tried
to rerun up to 9000 R scripts downloaded from the Harvard Dataverse. There were
several issues when trying to rerun the scripts, which lead to, and I quote the
paper here, "[...] 74% of R files [failing] to complete without error in the
initial execution, while 56% failed when code cleaning was applied, showing that
many errors can be prevented with good coding practices".

The take-away message is that counting on the language itself being stable through
time as a sufficient condition for reproducibility is not enough. We have to set
up the code in a way that it actually is reproducible.

So what does this all mean? This means that reproducibility is on a continuum,
and depending on the constraints you face your project can be "not very
reproducible" to "totally reproducible". Let's consider the following list of
anything that can influence how reproducible your project truly is:

- Version of the programming language used;
- Versions of the packages/libraries of said programming language used;
- Operating System, and its version;
- Versions of the underlying system libraries (which often go hand in hand with OS version, but not necessarily).
- And even the hardware architecture that you run all that software stack on.

So by "reproducibility is on a continuum", what I mean is that you could set up
your project in a way that none, one, two, three, four or all of the preceding
items are taken into consideration when making your project reproducible.

This is not a novel, or new idea. @peng2011 already discussed this concept
but named it the *reproducibility spectrum*. In part 2 of this book, I will
reintroduce the idea and call it the "reproducibility iceberg".

Let me just finish this introduction by discussing the last item on the previous
list: hardware architecture. You see, Apple has changed the hardware
architecture of their computers recently. Their new computers don't use Intel
based hardware anymore, but instead Apple's own proprietary architecture (Apple
Silicon) based on the ARM specification. And what does that mean concretely? It
means that all the binary packages that were built for Intel based Apple
computers cannot run on their new computers (at least not without a
compatibility layer). Which means that if you have a recent M1 or M2 Macbook and
need to install old CRAN packages to rerun a project (and we will learn how to
do this later in the book), these need to be compiled to work on Apple Silicon
first. You cannot even install older versions of R, unless you also compile
those from source! Now I have read about a compatibility layer called Rosetta
which enables to run binaries compiled for the Intel architecture on the ARM
architecture, and maybe this works well with R and CRAN binaries compiled for
Intel architecture. Maybe, I don't know. But my point is that you never know
what might come in the future, and thus needing to be able to compile from
source is important, because compiling from source is what requires the least
amount of dependencies that are outside of your control. Relying on binaries is
not future-proof (and which is again, another reason why open-source tools are a
hard requirement for reproducibility).

And for you Windows users, don't think that the preceding paragraph does not
concern you. I think that it is very likely that Microsoft will push in the
future for OEM manufacturers to build more ARM based computers. There is already
an ARM version of Windows after all, and it has been around for quite some time,
and I think that Microsoft will not kill that version any time in the future.
This is because ARM is much more energy efficient than other architectures, and
any manufacturer can build its own ARM cpus by purchasing a license, which can
be quite interesting from a business perspective. For example in the case of
Apple Silicon cpus, Apple can now get exactly the cpus they want for their
machines and make their software work seamlessly with it (also, further locking
in their users to their hardware). I doubt that others will pass the chance to
do the same.

Also, something else that might happen is that we might move towards more and
more cloud based computing, but I think that this scenario is less likely than
the one from before. But who knows. And in that case it is quite likely that the
actual code will be running on Linux servers that will likely be ARM based
because of energy and licensing costs. Here again, if you want to run your
historical code, you'll have to compile old packages and R versions from source.

Ok, so this might seem all incredibly complicated. How on earth are we supposed
to manage all these risks and balance the immediate need for results with the
future need of rerunning an old project? And what if rerunning this old project
is not even needed in the future?

This is where this book will help you. By employing the techniques discussed in
this book, not only will it be very easy and quick to set up a project from the
ground up that is truly reproducible, the very fact of building the project this
way will also ensure that you avoid mistakes and producing results that are
wrong. It will be easier and faster to iterate and improve your code, to
collaborate, and ultimately to trust the results of your pipelines. So even if
no one will rerun that code ever again, you will still benefit from the best
practices presented in this book. Let's dive in!
