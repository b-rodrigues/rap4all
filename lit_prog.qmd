# Literate programming

You now know about version control, how to collaborate using Github.com and
functional programming. By only learning about this, you have already made some
massive steps towards making your projects reproducible. Especially by using Git
and Github. Even if you're using private repos and work in the private sector,
by using version control, you ensure that reusing this code for future projects
is much easier. Auditing is greatly simplified as well.

But this book is still far from over. Let's think about our project up until
now. We have downloaded some data, and wrote code to analyse it. Fair enough.
But usually, we don't really stop there. We now need to write a report, or maybe
a Powerpoint presentation. If you're a researcher, you still need to write a
paper, just getting the results is not enough, and if you work in the private
sector, you also need to present the results of your analysis to management.

::: {.content-visible when-format="pdf"}
```{r, echo = F}
#| fig-cap: "The cursed report drafting loop."
knitr::include_graphics("images/report_draft_loop.png")
```
:::

The problem is that writing code, getting some results, and putting these results
into a document (it doesn’t matter what kind) is often very tedious. The picture
above illustrates this cursed report drafting loop. Get some results, copy and
paste images into Word or Powerpoint, get a change request, or notice a mistake,
and start from scratch again. If you're using LaTeX it'll be easier for
pictures, but you'll still need to update tables by hand each time you need to
touch your analysis code.

Worse, what if you start with a Word or LaTeX document, but then get asked to
make a Powerpoint presentation as well? Then you need to copy and paste
everything again, but this time into Powerpoint... and if you get a change
request after you're done and need to start over, you might seriously consider
raising goats instead of dealing with this again.

But if we can make the loop look like this instead:

::: {.content-hidden when-format="pdf"}
<figure>
    <img src="images/md_draft_loop.png"
         alt="The holy report drafting loop."></img>
    <figcaption>The holy report drafting loop.</figcaption>
</figure>
:::

::: {.content-visible when-format="pdf"}
```{r, echo = F}
#| fig-cap: "The holy report drafting loop."
knitr::include_graphics("images/md_draft_loop.png")
```
:::

Basically, everything from cleaning, analysing and drafting is done in one
single step? Well, this is what literate programming enables you to do. And even
if you get asked to make a Powerpoint presentation, you can start from the same
source code as the original report, and remove everything that you don't need
and compile to a Powerpoint (or Beamer) presentation.

## A quick history of literate programming

In literate programming, authors mix code and prose, which makes the output of
their programs not just a series of tables, or graphs or predictions, but a
complete report that contains the results of the analysis directly embedded into
it. Scripts written using literate programming are also very easy to compile, or
render, into a variety of document formats like `html`, `docx`, `pdf` or even
`pptx`. R supports several frameworks for literate programming: Sweave, knitr
and Quarto.

Sweave was the first tool available to R (and S) users, and allowed the mixing
of R and LaTeX code to create a document. Friedrich Leisch developed Sweave in
2002 and described it in his 2002 paper [@leisch2002]. As Leisch argues, *the
traditional way of writing a report as part of a statistical data analysis
project uses two separate steps*: running the analysis using some software, and
then copy and pasting the results into a word processing tool (as illustrated
above). To really drive that point home: the problem with this approach is that
much time is wasted copy and pasting things, so experimenting with different
layouts or data analysis techniques is very time-consuming. Copy and paste
mistakes will also happen (it’s not a question of if, but when) and updating
reports (for example, when new data comes in) means that someone will have,
again, to copy and paste the updated results into a new document.

Sweave makes it possible to embed the analysis in the final document itself, by
providing a way to mix LaTeX and R code which gets executed whenever the final,
output document gets compiled. This gives practitioners considerable time
savings because it eliminates the copy and pasting of results from R outputs
into a document.

The snippet below shows the example from Leisch’s paper:

```
\documentclass[a4paper]{article}

\begin{document}

In this example we embed parts of the examples from the
\texttt{kruskal.test} help page into a LaTeX document:

<<>>=
data (airquality)
kruskal.test(Ozone ~ Month, data = airquality)
@

which shows that the location parameter of the Ozone
distribution varies significantly from month to month.
Finally we include a boxplot of the data:

\begin{center}
<<fig=TRUE,echo=FALSE>>=
boxplot(Ozone ~ Month, data = airquality)
@
\end{center}

\end{document}
```

Even if you’ve never seen a LaTeX source file, you should be able to figure out
what’s going on. The first line states what type of document we’re writing. Then
comes `\begin{document}` which tells the compiler where the document starts.
Then comes the content. You can see that it’s a mixture of plain English with R
code defined inside chunks starting with `<<>>=` and ending with `@`. Finally,
the document ends with `\end{document}`. Getting a human-readable PDF from this
source is a two-step process: first, this source gets converted into a `.tex`
file and then this `.tex` file into a PDF. Sweave is included with every R
installation since version 1.5.0, and still works to this day. For example, we
can test that our Sweave installation works just fine by compiling the example
above. This is what the final output looks like:

::: {.content-hidden when-format="pdf"}
<figure>
    <img src="images/hello_sweave.PNG"
         alt="More than 20 years later, the output is still the same."></img>
    <figcaption>More than 20 years later, the output is still the same.</figcaption>
</figure>
:::

::: {.content-visible when-format="pdf"}
```{r, echo = F}
#| fig-cap: "More than 20 years later, the output is still the same."
knitr::include_graphics("images/hello_sweave.PNG")
```
:::

Let me just state that the fact that it is still possible to compile this
example more than 20 years later is an incredible testament to how mature and
stable this software is (both R, Sweave, and LaTeX). But as impressive as this
is, LaTeX has a steep learning curve, and Leisch even advocated the use of the
Emacs text editor to edit Sweave files, which also has a very steep learning
curve (but this is entirely optional; for example, I’ve edited and compiled the
example on the RStudio IDE).

The next generation of literate programming tools was provided by a package
called `{knitr}` in 2012. From the perspective of the user, the biggest change
from Sweave is that `{knitr}` is able to use many different formats as source
files. The one that became very likely the most widely used format is a flavour
of the Markdown markup language, R Markdown (Rmd). But this is not the only
difference with Sweave:`{knitr}` can also run code chunks for other languages,
such as Python, Perl, Awk, Haskell, bash and more [@xie2014]. Since version
1.18, `{knitr}` uses the `{reticulate}` package to provide a Python engine for
the Rmd format. 

::: {.content-visible when-format="pdf"}
\newpage
:::

To illustrate the Rmd format, let’s rewrite the example from
Leisch’s Sweave paper into it:

````{verbatim}
---
output: pdf_document
---

In this example we embed parts of the examples from the
\texttt{kruskal.test} help page into a LaTeX document:

```{r}
data (airquality)
kruskal.test(Ozone ~ Month, data = airquality)
```

which shows that the location parameter of the Ozone
distribution varies significantly from month to month.
Finally we include a boxplot of the data:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
boxplot(Ozone ~ Month, data = airquality)
```

````

This is what the output looks like:

::: {.content-hidden when-format="pdf"}
<figure>
    <img src="images/hello_rmd.PNG"
         alt="It’s very close to the Sweave output."></img>
    <figcaption>It’s very close to the Sweave output.</figcaption>
</figure>
:::

::: {.content-visible when-format="pdf"}
```{r, echo = F}
#| fig-cap: "It’s very close to the Sweave output."
knitr::include_graphics("images/hello_rmd.PNG")
```
:::

Just like in a Sweave document, an Rmd source file also has a header in which
authors can define a number of general options. Here I’ve only specified that I wanted a
pdf document as an output file. I then copy and pasted the contents from the
Sweave source, but changed the chunk delimiters from `<<>>=` and `@` to ```` ```{r} ```` to start an R chunk and ```` ``` ```` to end it. Remember; we need
to specify the engine in the chunk because `{knitr}` supports many engines. For
example, it is possible to run a bash command by adding this chunk to the
source:

````{verbatim}
---
output: pdf_document
---

In this example we embed parts of the examples from the
\texttt{kruskal.test} help page into a LaTeX document:

```{r}
data (airquality)
kruskal.test(Ozone ~ Month, data = airquality)
```

which shows that the location parameter of the Ozone
distribution varies significantly from month to month.
Finally we include a boxplot of the data:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
boxplot(Ozone ~ Month, data = airquality)
```

```{bash}
pwd
```

````

(bash’s `pwd` command shows the current working directory). You may have noticed
that I’ve also kept two LaTeX commands in the source Rmd, `\texttt{}` and `LaTeX`.
This is because Rmd files get first converted into `LaTeX` files and then into a
PDF. If you’re using RStudio, this document can be compiled by clicking a button
or using a keyboard shortcut, but you can also use the `rmarkdown::render()`
function. This function does two things transparently: it first converts the Rmd
file into a source LaTeX file, and then converts it into a PDF. It is of course
possible to convert the document to a Word document as well, but in this case,
LaTeX commands will be ignored. Html is another widely used output format.

If you're a researcher and prefer working with LaTeX directly instead of having
to switch to Markdown, you can either use Sweave, or use `{knitr}` but instead
of writing your documents using the R Markdown format, you can use the `Rnw`
format which is basically the same as Sweave, but uses `{knitr}` for
compilation. Take a look at [this
example](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/blob/master/inst/examples/knitr-minimal.Rnw)^[https://is.gd/Z7VS09]
from the `{knitr}` Github repository for example.

You should know that `{knitr}` makes it possible to author many, many different
types of documents. It is possible to write books, blogs, package documentation
(and even entire packages, as we shall see later in this book), Powerpoint
slides... It is extremely powerful because we can use the same general R
Markdown knowledge to build many different outputs.

```
:::

Finally, the latest in literate programming for R is a new tool developed by
Posit, called Quarto. If you’re an R user and already know `{knitr}` and the Rmd
format, you should be able to immediately use Quarto. So what’s the difference?
In practice and for R users not much but there are some things that Quarto is
able to do out of the box for which you'd need extensions with `{knitr}`. Quarto
has some nice defaults; in fact, this book is written in Quarto's Markdown
flavour and compiled with Quarto instead of `{knitr}` because the default Quarto
output looks nicer than the default `{knitr}` output. However, there may even be
things that Quarto can’t do at all (at least for now) when compared to
`{knitr}`. So why bother switching? Well, Quarto provides sane defaults and some
nice features out of the box, and the cost of switching from the Rmd format to
Quarto’s Qmd format is basically 0. Also, and this is probably the biggest
reason to use Quarto, Quarto is not tied to R. Quarto is actually a standalone
tool that needs to be installed alongside your R installation, and works
completely independently. In fact, you can use Quarto without having R installed
at all, as Quarto, just like `{knitr}` supports many engines. This means that if
you’re primarily using Python, you can use Quarto to author documents that mix
Python chunks and prose. Quarto also supports the Julia programming language and
Observable JS, making it possible to include interactive visualisations into an
Html document. Let’s take a look at how the example from Leisch’s paper looks as
a Qmd (Quarto’s flavour of Markdown) file:

````{verbatim}
---
output: pdf
---

In this example we embed parts of the examples from the
\texttt{kruskal.test} help page into a LaTeX document:

```{r}
data (airquality)
kruskal.test(Ozone ~ Month, data = airquality)
```

which shows that the location parameter of the Ozone
distribution varies significantly from month to month.
Finally we include a boxplot of the data:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
boxplot(Ozone ~ Month, data = airquality)
```

````

(I’ve omitted the bash chunk from before, not because Quarto does not support
it, but to keep close to the original example from the paper.)

As you can see, it’s exactly the same as the Rmd file from before. The only
difference is in the header. In the Rmd file I specified the output format as:

````
---
output: pdf_document
---
````

whereas in the Qmd file we changed it to:

````
---
output: pdf
---
````

While Quarto is the latest option in literate programming, it is quite recent,
and as such, I feel it might be better to stick with `{knitr}` and the Rmd
format for now, so that’s what we’re going to use going forward. Also, the
`{knitr}` and the Rmd format are here to stay, so there's little risk in keeping
using it, and anyways, as already stated, if switching to Quarto becomes a
necessity, the cost of switching would be very, very low. In what follows, I
won’t be focused on anything really `{knitr}` or Rmd specific, so should you
want to use Quarto instead, you should be able to follow along without any
problems at all, since the Rmd and Qmd formats have so much overlap. Also,
Quarto needs to be installed separately, but to use `{knitr}` and RMarkdown,
no specific tools are necessary.

In the next two sections, I will show you how to set up and use `{knitr}` as
well as give you a quick overview of the R Markdown syntax. However, we will
very quickly focus on the templating capabilities of `{knitr}`: expanding text,
using child documents, and parameterised reports. These are advanced topics and
not easy to tackle if you’re not comfortable with R already. Just as functions
and higher-order functions like `lapply()` avoid having to repeat yourself, so
does templating, but for literate programming. The goal is to write functions
that return literal R Markdown code, so that you can loop over these functions
to build entire sections of your documents. However, the learning curve for
these features is quite steep, but by now, you should have noticed that this
book expects a lot from you. Keep going, and you shall be handsomely rewarded.

## `{knitr}` basics

This section will be a very small intro to `{knitr}`. I’m going to teach you
just enough to get started writing Rmd files. Most, if not all, of what I’ll be
explaining here is also applicable to the Qmd format. There are many resources
out there that you can use if you want to dig deeper, for instance the [R
Markdown
website](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html)^[https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html]
from Posit, or the [R Markdown: The Definitive
Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/)^[https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/]
and [R Markdown
Cookbook](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/)^[https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/]
eBooks. I will also not assume that you are using the RStudio IDE and give you
instead the lower level commands to render documents. If you use RStudio and
want to know how to use it effectively to author Rmd documents, you should take
a look at
[this](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_quick_tour.html)^[https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_quick_tour.html]
page. In fact, this section will basically focus on the same topics, but without
RStudio.

### Set up

The first step is to install the `{knitr}` and the `{rmarkdown}` packages.
That's easy, just type:

```{r, eval = F}
install.packages("rmarkdown")
```

in an R console. Since `{knitr}` is required to install `{rmarkdown}`, it gets
installed automatically. If you want to compile PDF documents, you should also
have a working LaTeX distribution. You can skip this next part if you’re only
interested in generating Html and Word files. For what follows in the book, we
will only be rendering Html documents, so no need to install LaTeX (by the way,
you don't even need a working Word installation to compile documents to the
`docx` format). However, if you already have a working LaTeX installation, you
shouldn’t have to do anything else to generate PDF documents. If you don’t have
a working LaTeX distribution, then Yihui Xie, the creator of `{knitr}` created
an R package called `{tinytex}` which you can use to install a working LaTeX
distribution very easily. In fact, this is the way I recommend installing LaTeX
even if you’re not an R user (it is possible to use the tinytex distribution
without R; it’s just that the `{tinytex}` R package provides many functions that
makes installing and maintaining it very easy). Simply run these commands in an
R console to get started:

```{r, eval = F}
install.packages("tinytex")
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

and that’s it! If you need to install specific LaTeX packages, then refer to the
**Maintenance** section on [tinytex’s](https://yihui.org/tinytex/#maintenance)^[https://yihui.org/tinytex/#maintenance]
website. For example, to compile the example from Leisch’s article on Sweave
discussed previously, the `grfext` LaTeX package needs to be installed (as
explained by the error output in the console when I tried compiling). To install
this package, you can use the `tlmgr_install()` function from `{tinytex}`:

```{r, eval = F}
tlmgr_install("grfext")
```

After you’ve installed `{knitr}`, `{rmarkdown}` and, optionally, `{tinytex}`,
simply try to compile the following document:

````{verbatim}
---
output: html_document
---

# Document title

## Section title

### Subsection title

This is **bold** text. This is *text in italics*.

My favourite programming language for statistics is ~~SAS~~ R.

````

save this document into a file called `rmd_test.rmd` using your favourite
text editor. Then render it into an Html file by running the following command
in the R console:

```{r, eval = F}
rmarkdown::render("path/to/rmd_test.rmd")
```

This should create a file called `rmd_test.html`; open it with your web browser
and you should see the following:

::: {.content-hidden when-format="pdf"}
<figure>
    <img src="images/rmd_test.PNG"
         alt="This is how formatting looks like, once the document is compiled."></img>
    <figcaption>This is how formatting looks like, once the document is compiled.</figcaption>
</figure>
:::

::: {.content-visible when-format="pdf"}
```{r, echo = F}
#| fig-cap: "This is how formatting looks like, once the document is compiled."
knitr::include_graphics("images/rmd_test.PNG")
```
:::

Congratulations, you just *knitted* your first Rmd document!

### Markdown ultrabasics

R Markdown is a flavour of Markdown, which means that you should know some
Markdown to really take full advantage of R Markdown. The example document from
before should have already shown you some basics: titles, sections and
subsections all start with a `#` and the depth level is determined by the number
of `#`s. For bold text, simply put the words in between `**` and for italics use
only one `*`. If you want ***bold and italics***, use `***`. The original
designer of Markdown did not think that underlining text was important, so there
is no *easy* way of doing it, unfortunately. For this, you need to use a
somewhat hidden feature; without going into too many technical details, the
program that converts Rmd files to the final output format is called Pandoc, and
it’s possible to use some of Pandoc's features to format text. For example, for
underlining:

````{verbatim}
[This is some underlined text in a R Markdown document]{.underline}
````

This will underline the text between square brackets.[^1]

[^1]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/68690065/1298051

The next step is to mix code and prose. As you’ve seen from Leisch’s canonical
example, this is quite easily achieved by using R code chunks. The R Markdown
example below shows various code chunks alongside some options. For example, a
code chunk that uses the `echo = FALSE` option will not appear (but the output
of the computation will):

````{verbatim}
---
title: "Document title"
output: html_document
date: "2023-01-28"
---

# R code chunks

This below is an R code chunk:


```{r}
data(mtcars)

plot(mtcars)
```

The code chunk above will appear in the final output. 
The code chunk below will be hidden:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
data(iris)

plot(iris)
```

This next code chunk will not be evaluated:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
data(titanic)

str(titanic)
```

The last one below runs, but code and output from the code is 
not shown in the final document. This is useful for loading 
libraries and hiding startup messages:

```{r, include = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
```

````

If you use RStudio and create a new R Markdown file from the menu, a template R
Markdown file is generated for you to fill out. The first R chunk is this one:

````{verbatim}
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
````

This is an R chunk named `setup` with the option `include = FALSE` (so neither
the chunk itself, nor the output it produces will be shown in the compiled
document). Naming chunks is optional, but we are going to make use of this later
on. The code that runs in this chunk defines a global option to show the source
code from all the chunks by default (which is the default behaviour). You can
change `TRUE` to `FALSE` if you want to hide every code chunk instead (if you’re
using Quarto, global options are set
[differently](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/execution-options.html
)^[https://quarto.org/docs/computations/execution-options.html]).

Something else you might have noticed in the previous example, is that we’ve
added some more content in the header:

````{verbatim}
---
title: "Document title"
output: html_document
date: "2023-01-28"
---
````

There are several other options available that you can define in the header.
Later on, I will show you some more options, for example how to define a table of
contents.

To finish this part on code chunks, you should know about inline code chunks.
Take a look at the following example:

````{verbatim}
---
title: "Document title"
output: html_document
date: "2023-01-28"
---

# R code chunks


```{r, echo = FALSE}
data(iris)
```

The iris dataset has `r nrow(iris)` rows.
````

The last sentence from this example has an inline code chunk. This is quite
useful, as it allows to parameterise sentences and paragraphs, and thus avoids
needing to copy and paste (and we will go quite far into how to avoid copy and
pasting, thanks to more advanced features we will shortly discuss).

To finish this crash course, you should know that to use footnotes you need to
write the following:

````{verbatim}
This sentence has a footnote.[^1]

[^1]: This is the footnote.
````

or the following (which I prefer):

````{verbatim}
This sentence has a footnote.^[This is the footnote]
````

and that you can write LaTeX formulas as well. For example, add the lines below
into the example from before and render either a PDF or an HTML document (don’t
put the LaTeX formula below inside a chunk, simply paste it as if it were normal
text. This doesn’t work for Word output because Word does not support LaTeX
equations):

```
\begin{align*}
S(\omega) 
&= \frac{\alpha g^2}{\omega^5} 
  e^{[ -0.74\bigl\{\frac{\omega U_\omega 19.5}{g}\bigr\}
   ^{\!-4}\,]} \\
&= \frac{\alpha g^2}{\omega^5} 
\exp\Bigl[ -0.74\Bigl\{\frac{\omega U_\omega 19.5}{g}\Bigr\}
  ^{\!-4}\,\Bigr] 
\end{align*}
```

The LaTeX code above results in this equation:

::: {.content-hidden when-format="pdf"}
<figure>
    <img src="images/latex_equation.png"
         alt="A rendered LaTeX equation."></img>
    <figcaption>A rendered LaTeX equation.</figcaption>
</figure>
:::

::: {.content-visible when-format="pdf"}
```{r, echo = F, out.width="200px"}
#| fig-cap: "A rendered LaTeX equation."
knitr::include_graphics("images/latex_equation.png")
```
:::

## Keeping it DRY

Remember; we never, ever, want to have to repeat ourselves. Copy and pasting is
forbidden. Striving for 0 copy and pasting will make our code much more robust
and likely to be correct.

To keep DRY, we started by using functions, as discussed in the previous
chapter, but we can go much further than that. For example, suppose that we need
to write a document that has the following structure:

- A title
- A section
- A table inside this section
- Another section
- Another table inside this section
- Yet another section
- Yet another table inside this section

Is there a way to automate the creation of such a document by taking advantage
of the repeating structure? Of course there is. The question is not, *is it
possible to do X?*, but *how to do X?*.

### Generating R Markdown code from code

The example below is a fully working minimal example of this. Copy it inside a
document titled something like `rmd_templating.Rmd` and render it. You will see
that the output contains more sections than defined in the source. This is
because we use templating at the end. Take some time to read the document, as
the text inside explains what is going on:

````{verbatim}
---
title: "Templating"
output: html_document
date: "2023-01-27"
---

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## A function that creates tables

```{r}
create_table <- function(dataset, var){
  table(dataset[var]) |>
    knitr::kable()
}
```

The function above uses the `table()` function to create 
frequency tables, and then this gets passed to the 
`knitr::kable()` function that produces a good looking table 
for our rendered document:

```{r}
create_table(mtcars, "am")
```

Let’s suppose that we want to generate a document that would
look like this:

- first a section title, with the name of the variable of interest
- then the table

So it would look like this:

## Frequency table for variable: "am"

```{r}
create_table(mtcars, "am")
```

We don’t want to create these sections for
every variable by hand.

Instead, we can define a function that
returns the R markdown code required to
create this. This is this function:

```{r}
return_section <- function(dataset, var){
  a <- knitr::knit_expand(text = c(
               "## Frequency table for variable: {{variable}}",
                create_table(dataset, var)),
                variable = var)
  cat(a, sep = "\n")
}
```

This new function, `return_section()` uses 
`knitr::knit_expand()` to generate RMarkdown 
code. Words between `{{}}` get replaced by 
the provided `var` argument to the function. 
So when we call `return_section("am")`, 
`{{variable}}` is replaced by `"am"`. `"am"` 
then gets passed down to `create_table()` 
and the frequency table gets generated. 
We can now generate all the section by simply
applying our function to a list of column names:

```{r, results = "asis"}
invisible(lapply(colnames(mtcars), return_section, dataset = mtcars))
```

````

The last function, named `return_section()` uses `knit_expand()`, which
is the function that does the heavy lifting. This function returns literal R
Markdown code. It returns `## Frequency table for variable: {{variable}}` which
creates a level 2 section title with the text *Frequency table for variable:
xxx* where the `xxx` will get replaced by the variable passed to
`return_section()`. So calling `return_section(mtcars, "am")` will print the
following in your console:

```
## Frequency table for variable: am
|am | Freq|
|:--|----:|
|0  |   19|
|1  |   13|
```

We now simply need to find a clever way to apply this function to each variable
in the `mtcars` dataset. For this, we are going to use `lapply()` which
implements a for loop (you could use `purrr::map()` just as well for this):

```{r, eval = FALSE}
invisible(lapply(colnames(mtcars),
                 return_section,
                 dataset = mtcars))
```

This will create, for each variable in `mtcars`, the same R Markdown code as
above. Notice that the R Markdown chunk where the call to `lapply()` is has the
option `results = "asis"`. This is because the function returns literal Markdown
code, and we don’t want the parser to have to parse it again. We tell the parser
"don’t worry about this bit of code, it’s already good". As you see, the call to
`lapply()` is wrapped inside `invisible()`. This is because `return_section()`
does not return anything, it just prints something to the console. No object is
returned. `return_section()` is a function with only a side-effect: it changes
something outside its scope. So if you don’t wrap the call to `lapply()` inside
`invisible()`, then a bunch of `NULL`s will also get printed (`NULL`s get
returned by functions that don't return anything). To avoid this, use
`invisible()` (and use `purrr::walk()` rather than `purrr::map()` if you want to
use tidyverse packages and functions).

See the output [here](https://jolly-arithmetic-ce29cf.netlify.app/)^[https://is.gd/EzdUtt].

This is not an easy topic, so take the time to play around with the example
above. Try to print another table, try to generate more complex Markdown code,
remove the call to `invisible()` and knit the document and see what happens with
the output, replace the call to `lapply()` with `purrr::walk()` or
`purrr::map()`. Really take the time to understand what is going on.

While extremely powerful, this approach using `knit_expand()` only works if your
template only contains text. If you need to print something more complicated in
the document, you need to use child documents instead. For example, suppose that
instead of a table we wanted to show a plot made using `{ggplot2}`. This would
not work, because a ggplot object is not made of text, but is a list with many
elements. The `print()` method for ggplot objects then does some magic and
prints a plot. But if you want to show plots using `knitr::knit_expand()`, then
the contents of the list will be shown, not the plot itself. This is where child
documents come in. Child documents are exactly what you think they are: they’re
smaller documents that get knitted and then embedded into the parent document.
You can define anything within these child documents, and as such you can even
use them to print more complex objects, like a ggplot object. Let’s go back to
the example from before and make use of a child document (for ease of
presentation, we will not use a separate Rmd file, but will inline the child
document into the main document). Read the Rmd example below carefully, as all
the steps are explained:

````{verbatim}
---
title: "Templating with child documents"
output: html_document
date: "2023-01-27"
---

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(ggplot2)
```

## A function that creates ggplots

```{r}
create_plot <- function(dataset, aesthetic){

  ggplot(dataset) +
    geom_point(aesthetic)

}
```

The function above takes a dataset and an aesthetic 
made using `ggplot2::aes()` to create a plot:

```{r}
create_plot(mtcars, aes(y = mpg, x = hp))
```

Let’s suppose that we want to generate a document 
that would look like this:

- first a section title, with the dataset used;
- then a plot

So it would look like this:

## Dataset used: "mtcars"

```{r}
create_plot(mtcars, aes(y = mpg, x = hp))
```

We don’t want to create these sections for every 
aesthetic by hand.

Instead, we can make use of a child document that 
gets knitted separately and then embedded in the 
parent document. The chunk below makes use of this trick:

```{r, results = "asis"}

x <- list(aes(y = mpg, x = hp),
          aes(y = mpg, x = hp, size = am))

res <- lapply(x,
              function(dataset, x){

  knitr::knit_child(text = c(

    '\n',
    '## Dataset used: `r deparse(substitute(dataset))`',
    '\n',
    '```{r, echo = F}',
    'print(create_plot(dataset, x))',
    '```'

     ),
     envir = environment(),
     quiet = TRUE)

}, dataset = mtcars)


cat(unlist(res), sep = "\n")
```

The child document is the `text` argument to the 
`knit_child()` function. `text` is literal R Markdown 
code: we define a level 2 header, and then an R chunk. 
This child document gets knitted, so we need to specify 
the environment in which it should get knitted. This means
that the child document will get knitted in the same 
environment as the parent document (our current global
environment). This way, every package that gets loaded 
and every function or variable that got defined in the 
parent document will also be available to the child document.

To get the dataset name as a string, we use the 
`deparse(substitute(dataset))` trick; this substitutes 
"dataset" by its bound value, so `mtcars`. But `mtcars` is 
an expression and we don’t want it to get evaluated, or the 
contents of the entire dataset would be used in the title 
of the section. So we use `deparse()` which turns unevaluated 
expressions into strings.

We then use `lapply()` to loop over two aesthetics with an 
anonymous function that encapsulates the child document. So we 
get two child documents that get knitted, one per aesthetic. 
This gets saved into variable `res`. This is thus a list of 
knitted Markdown.

Finally, we need unlist `res` to actually merge the Markdown 
code from the child documents into the parent document.

Here again, take some time to play with the above example. Change the child
document, try to print other types of output, really take your time to
understand this. To know more about child documents, take a look at [this
section](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/child-document.html#child-document)^[https://is.gd/gAqzf9]
of the R Markdown Cookbook [@xie2020r].

By the way, if you wish to add a table of contents to your document, change the
header to this:


````{verbatim}
---
title: "Templating with child documents and TOC"
output: 
  html_document:
    toc: true
    toc_float: true
date: "2023-01-27"
---
````

### Tables in R Markdown documents

Getting tables right in Rmd documents is not always an easy task. There are
several packages specifically made just for this task, and the package
that I recommend tick the following two important boxes:

- Work the same way regardless of output format (Word, PDF or Html);
- Work for any type of table: summary tables, regression tables, two-way tables, etc.

Let's start with the simplest type of table, which would be a table that simply
shows some rows of data. `{knitr}` comes with the `kable()` function, but this
function generates a very plain looking output. For something
publication-worthy, we recommend the `{flextable}` package, developed by
@gohel23:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(flextable)

my_table <- head(mtcars)

flextable(my_table) |>
  set_caption(caption = "Head of the mtcars dataset") |>
  theme_booktabs()

```

::: {.content-hidden when-format="pdf"}
<figure>
    <img src="images/flextable.png"
         alt="The output of the code above."></img>
    <figcaption>The output of the code above.</figcaption>
</figure>
:::

::: {.content-visible when-format="pdf"}
```{r, echo = F}
#| fig-cap: "The output of the code above."
knitr::include_graphics("images/flextable.png")
```
:::

Note that the example above will work pretty much the same way for any table
that you can coerce into a data frame! I won't explain how
`{flextable}` works, but it is very powerful, and the fact that it works for
PDF, Html, Word and Powerpoint outputs is really a massive plus. If you want to
learn more about `{flextable}`, there's a [whole, free, ebook on
it](https://ardata-fr.github.io/flextable-book/index.html)^[https://ardata-fr.github.io/flextable-book/index.html].
`{flextable}` can create very complicated tables, so really take the time to dig
in!

The next package is `{modelsummary}`, by @arel22, and this one focuses on
regression and summary tables. It is extremely powerful as well, and just like
`{flextable}`, works for any type of output. It is very simple to get started:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(modelsummary)

model_1 <- lm(mpg ~ hp + am, data = mtcars)
model_2 <- lm(mpg ~ hp, data = mtcars)

models <- list("Model 1" = model_1,
               "Model 2" = model_2)

modelsummary(models)

```

::: {.content-hidden when-format="pdf"}
<figure>
    <img src="images/modelsummary.png"
         alt="Estimated models are shown side by side."></img>
    <figcaption>Estimated models are shown side by side.</figcaption>
</figure>
:::

::: {.content-visible when-format="pdf"}
```{r, echo = F, out.width = "200px"}
#| fig-cap: "Estimated models are shown side by side."
knitr::include_graphics("images/modelsummary.png")
```
:::

Here again, I won't got into much detail, but recommend instead that you read
the package's
[website](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/modelsummary/articles/modelsummary.html)^[https://is.gd/pjIKmV]
which has very detailed documentation.

These packages can help you keeping it DRY, so take some time to learn them.

And one last thing: if you’re a researcher, take a look at the
[`{rticles}`](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/rticles/articles/examples.html)^[https://pkgs.rstudio.com/rticles/articles/examples.html]
package, which provides Rmd templates to write articles for many scientific
journals.

### Parametrized reports

Templating and child documents are very powerful, but sometimes you don't want
to have one section dedicated to each unit of analysis within the same report,
but rather, you want a complete separate report by unit of analysis. This is
possible thanks to parameterised reports.

Let's change the example from before, which consisted of creating one section
per column of the `mtcars` dataset and a frequency table, and make it now one
separate report for each column. The R Markdown file will look like this:

````{verbatim}
---
title: "Report for column `r params$var` of dataset `r params$dataset`"
output: html_document
date: "2023-01-27"
params:
  dataset: mtcars
  var: "am"
---

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Frequency table for `r params$var`

```{r, echo = F}
create_table <- function(dataset, var){

  dataset <- get(dataset)

  table(dataset[var]) |>
    knitr::kable()
}
```

The table below is for variable `r params$var` of 
dataset `r params$dataset`.

```{r}
create_table(params$dataset, params$var)
```


```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
# Run these lines to compile the document
# Set eval and echo to FALSE, so that this does not appear
# in the output, and does not get evaluated when knitting
rmarkdown::render(
             input = "param_report_example.Rmd",
             params = list(
               dataset = "mtcars",
               var = "cyl"
             )
           )

```
````

Save the code above into an Rmd file titled something like
`param_report_example.Rmd` (preferably inside its own folder). Note that at the
end of the document, I wrote the lines to render this document inside a chunk
that does not get shown to the reader, nor gets evaluated:

````{verbatim}
```{r, eval = F, echo = FALSE}
rmarkdown::render(
             input = "param_report_example.Rmd",
             params = list(
               dataset = "mtcars",
               var = "cyl"
             )
           )
```
````

You need to run these lines yourself to knit the document.

This will pass the list `params` with elements "mtcars" and "cyl" down to the
report. Every `params$dataset` and `params$var` in the report gets replaced by
"mtcars" and "cyl" respectively. Also, notice that in the header of the
document, I defined default values for the params. Something else you need to
be aware of, is that the function `create_table()` inside the report is slightly
different than before. It now starts with the following line:

```{r, eval = F}
dataset <- get(dataset)
```

Let's break this down. `params$dataset` contains the string "mtcars". I made the
decision to pass the dataset as a string, so that I could use it in the title of
the document. But then, inside the `create_table()` function, I have the
following code:

```{r, eval = F}
dataset[var]
```

`dataset` can't be a string here, but needs to be a variable name, so `mtcars`
and not `"mtcars"`. This means that I need to *convert* that string into a name.
`get()` searches an object by name, and then makes it possible to save it to a
new variable called `dataset`. The rest of the function is then the same as
before. This little difficulty can be avoided by hard-coding the dataset inside
the R Markdown file, or by passing the dataset as the `params$dataset` and not
the string, in the render function. However, if you pass down the name of the
dataset as a variable instead of the dataset name as a string, then you need to
covert it to a string if you want to use it in the text (so `mtcars` to
`"mtcars"`, using `deparse(substitute(dataset))` as in child documents example).

If you instead want to create one report per variable, you could compile all the
documents at once with:

````{verbatim}
```{r, eval = F, echo = F}
columns <- colnames(mtcars)

lapply(columns,
  (\(x)rmarkdown::render(
                    input = "param_report_example.Rmd",
                    output_file = paste0(
                      "param_report_example_", x, ".html"
                    ),
                    params = list(
                      dataset = "mtcars",
                      var = x
                    )
                  )
  )
)
```
````

By now, this should not intimidate you anymore; I use `lapply()` to loop over a
list of column names (that I get using `colnames()`). Because I don't want to
overwrite the report I need to change the name of the output file. I do so by
using `paste0()` which creates a new string that contains the variable name, so
each report gets its own name. `x` inside the `paste0()` function is each
element, one after the other, of the `columns` variable I defined first. Think
of it as the `i` in a for loop. I then must also pass this to the `params`
list, hence the `var = x`. The complete call to `rmarkdown::render()` is wrapped
inside an anonymous function, because I need to use the argument `x` (which is
each column defined in the columns list) in different places.

## Conclusion

Before continuing, I highly recommend that you try running this yourself, and
also that you try to build your own little parameterised reports. Maybe start by
replacing "mtcars" by "iris" in the code to compile the reports and see what
happens, and then when you're comfortable with parameterised reports, try
templating inside a parameterised report!

It is important not to succumb to the temptation of copy and pasting sections of
your report, or parts of your script, instead of using these more advanced
features provided by the language. It is tempting, especially under time
pressure, to just copy and paste bits of code and get things done instead of
writing what seems to be unnecessary code to finally achieve the same thing. The
problem, however, is that in practice copy and pasting code to simply get things
done will come bite you sooner rather than later. Especially when you're still
in the exploration/drafting phase of the project. It may take more time to set
up, but once you're done, it is much easier to experiment with different
parameters, test the code or even re-use the code for other projects. Not only
that but forcing you to actually think about how to set up your code in a way
that avoids repeating yourself also helps with truly understanding the problem
at hand. What part of the problem is constant and does not change? What does
change? How often, and why? Can you also fix these parts or not? What if instead
of five sections that I need to copy and paste, I had 50 sections? How would I 
handle this?

Asking yourself these questions, and solving them, will ultimately make you a
better programmer.

Remember: don't repeat yourself!
